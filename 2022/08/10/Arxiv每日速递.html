    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>
    <p>We present a new table structure recognition (TSR) approach, called
TSRFormer, to robustly recognizing the structures of complex tables with
geometrical distortions from various table images. Unlike previous methods, we
formulate table separation line prediction as a line regression problem instead
of an image segmentation problem and propose a new two-stage DETR based
separator prediction approach, dubbed \textbf{Sep}arator \textbf{RE}gression
\textbf{TR}ansformer (SepRETR), to predict separation lines from table images
directly. To make the two-stage DETR framework work efficiently and effectively
for the separation line prediction task, we propose two improvements: 1) A
prior-enhanced matching strategy to solve the slow convergence issue of DETR;
2) A new cross attention module to sample features from a high-resolution
convolutional feature map directly so that high localization accuracy is
achieved with low computational cost. After separation line prediction, a
simple relation network based cell merging module is used to recover spanning
cells. With these new techniques, our TSRFormer achieves state-of-the-art
performance on several benchmark datasets, including SciTSR, PubTabNet and WTW.
Furthermore, we have validated the robustness of our approach to tables with
complex structures, borderless cells, large blank spaces, empty or spanning
cells as well as distorted or even curved shapes on a more challenging
real-world in-house dataset.</p>

    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>
    <p>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone cancer whose standard treatment
includes pre-operative chemotherapy followed by resection. Chemotherapy
response is used for predicting prognosis and further management of patients.
Necrosis is routinely assessed post-chemotherapy from histology slides on
resection specimens where necrosis ratio is defined as the ratio of necrotic
tumor to overall tumor. Patients with necrosis ratio >=90% are known to have
better outcome. Manual microscopic review of necrosis ratio from multiple glass
slides is semi-quantitative and can have intra- and inter-observer variability.
We propose an objective and reproducible deep learning-based approach to
estimate necrosis ratio with outcome prediction from scanned hematoxylin and
eosin whole slide images. We collected 103 osteosarcoma cases with 3134 WSIs to
train our deep learning model, to validate necrosis ratio assessment, and to
evaluate outcome prediction. We trained Deep Multi-Magnification Network to
segment multiple tissue subtypes including viable tumor and necrotic tumor in
pixel-level and to calculate case-level necrosis ratio from multiple WSIs. We
showed necrosis ratio estimated by our segmentation model highly correlates
with necrosis ratio from pathology reports manually assessed by experts where
mean absolute differences for Grades IV (100%), III (>=90%), and II (>=50% and
<90%) necrosis response are 4.4%, 4.5%, and 17.8%, respectively. we successfully stratified patients to predict overall survival with p="10^-6" progression-free our reproducible approach without variability enabled us tune cutoff thresholds, specifically for model data set, 80% os 60% pfs. study indicates deep learning can support pathologists as an objective tool analyze osteosarcoma from histology assessing treatment predicting patient outcome.<>

    <p>This paper investigates the modeling of automated machine description on
sports video, which has seen much progress recently. Nevertheless,
state-of-the-art approaches fall quite short of capturing how human experts
analyze sports scenes. There are several major reasons: (1) The used dataset is
collected from non-official providers, which naturally creates a gap between
models trained on those datasets and real-world applications; (2) previously
proposed methods require extensive annotation efforts (i.e., player and ball
segmentation at pixel level) on localizing useful visual features to yield
acceptable results; (3) very few public datasets are available. In this paper,
we propose a novel large-scale NBA dataset for Sports Video Analysis (NSVA)
with a focus on captioning, to address the above challenges. We also design a
unified approach to process raw videos into a stack of meaningful features with
minimum labelling efforts, showing that cross modeling on such features using a
transformer architecture leads to strong performance. In addition, we
demonstrate the broad application of NSVA by addressing two additional tasks,
namely fine-grained sports action recognition and salient player
identification. Code and dataset are available at

    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>
    <p>Finding the conceptual difference between the two images in an industrial
environment has been especially important for HSE purposes and there is still
no reliable and conformable method to find the major differences to alert the
related controllers. Due to the abundance and variety of objects in different
environments, the use of supervised learning methods in this field is facing a
major problem. Due to the sharp and even slight change in lighting conditions
in the two scenes, it is not possible to naively subtract the two images in
order to find these differences. The goal of this paper is to find and localize
the conceptual differences of two frames of one scene but in two different
times and classify the differences to addition, reduction and change in the
field. In this paper, we demonstrate a comprehensive solution for this
application by presenting the deep learning method and using transfer learning
and structural modification of the error function, as well as a process for
adding and synthesizing data. An appropriate data set was provided and labeled,
and the model results were evaluated on this data set and the possibility of
using it in real and industrial applications was explained.</p>

    <p>We present an automated learning framework for a robotic sketching agent that
is capable of learning stroke-based rendering and motor control simultaneously.
We formulate the robotic sketching problem as a deep decoupled hierarchical
reinforcement learning; two policies for stroke-based rendering and motor
control are learned independently to achieve sub-tasks for drawing, and form a
hierarchy when cooperating for real-world drawing. Without hand-crafted
features, drawing sequences or trajectories, and inverse kinematics, the
proposed method trains the robotic sketching agent from scratch. We performed
experiments with a 6-DoF robot arm with 2F gripper to sketch doodles. Our
experimental results show that the two policies successfully learned the
sub-tasks and collaborated to sketch the target images. Also, the robustness
and flexibility were examined by varying drawing tools and surfaces.</p>

    <p>We present HyperNST; a neural style transfer (NST) technique for the artistic
stylization of images, based on Hyper-networks and the StyleGAN2 architecture.
Our contribution is a novel method for inducing style transfer parameterized by
a metric space, pre-trained for style-based visual search (SBVS). We show for
the first time that such space may be used to drive NST, enabling the
application and interpolation of styles from an SBVS system. The technical
contribution is a hyper-network that predicts weight updates to a StyleGAN2
pre-trained over a diverse gamut of artistic content (portraits), tailoring the
style parameterization on a per-region basis using a semantic map of the facial
regions. We show HyperNST to exceed state of the art in content preservation
for our stylized content while retaining good style transfer performance.</p>

    <p>Recognizing 3D part instances from a 3D point cloud is crucial for 3D
structure and scene understanding. Several learning-based approaches use
semantic segmentation and instance center prediction as training tasks and fail
to further exploit the inherent relationship between shape semantics and part
instances. In this paper, we present a new method for 3D part instance
segmentation. Our method exploits semantic segmentation to fuse nonlocal
instance features, such as center prediction, and further enhances the fusion
scheme in a multi- and cross-level way. We also propose a semantic region
center prediction task to train and leverage the prediction results to improve
the clustering of instance points. Our method outperforms existing methods with
a large-margin improvement in the PartNet benchmark. We also demonstrate that
our feature fusion scheme can be applied to other existing methods to improve
their performance in indoor scene instance segmentation tasks.</p>

    <p>With the vigorous development of mobile photography technology, major mobile
phone manufacturers are scrambling to improve the shooting ability of
equipments and the photo beautification algorithm of software. However, the
improvement of intelligent equipments and algorithms cannot replace human
subjective photography technology. In this paper, we propose the aesthetic
language guidance of image (ALG). We divide ALG into ALG-T and ALG-I according
to whether the guiding rules are based on photography templates or guidance
images. Whether it is ALG-T or ALG-I, we guide photography from three
attributes of color, lighting and composition of the images. The differences of
the three attributes between the input images and the photography templates or
the guidance images are described in natural language, which is aesthetic
natural language guidance (ALG). Also, because of the differences in lighting
and composition between landscape images and portrait images, we divide the
input images into landscape images and portrait images. Both ALG-T and ALG-I
conduct aesthetic language guidance respectively for the two types of input
images (landscape images and portrait images).</p>

    <p>We present HRF-Net, a novel view synthesis method based on holistic radiance
fields that renders novel views using a set of sparse inputs. Recent
generalizing view synthesis methods also leverage the radiance fields but the
rendering speed is not real-time. There are existing methods that can train and
render novel views efficiently but they can not generalize to unseen scenes.
Our approach addresses the problem of real-time rendering for generalizing view
synthesis and consists of two main stages: a holistic radiance fields predictor
and a convolutional-based neural renderer. This architecture infers not only
consistent scene geometry based on the implicit neural fields but also renders
new views efficiently using a single GPU. We first train HRF-Net on multiple 3D
scenes of the DTU dataset and the network can produce plausible novel views on
unseen real and synthetics data using only photometric losses. Moreover, our
method can leverage a denser set of reference images of a single scene to
produce accurate novel views without relying on additional explicit
representations and still maintains the high-speed rendering of the pre-trained
model. Experimental results show that HRF-Net outperforms state-of-the-art
generalizable neural rendering methods on various synthetic and real datasets.</p>

    <p>Due to the current COVID-19 virus, which has already been declared a pandemic
by the World Health Organization (WHO), we are witnessing the greatest pandemic
of the decade. Millions of people are being infected, resulting in thousands of
deaths every day across the globe. Even it was difficult for the best
healthcare-providing countries could not handle the pandemic because of the
strain of treating thousands of patients at a time. The count of infections and
deaths is increasing at an alarming rate because of the spread of the virus. We
believe that innovative technologies could help reduce pandemics to a certain
extent until we find a definite solution from the medical field to handle and
treat such pandemic situations. Technology innovation has the potential to
introduce new technologies that could support people and society during these
difficult times. Therefore, this paper proposes the idea of using drones as a
companion to tackle current and future pandemics. Our COROID drone is based on
the principle of crowdsourcing sensors data of the public's smart devices,
which can correlate the reading of the infrared cameras equipped on the COROID
drones. To the best of our knowledge, this concept has yet to be investigated
either as a concept or as a product. Therefore, we believe that the COROID

    <p>Vision Transformers (VTs) are becoming a valuable alternative to
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) when it comes to problems involving
high-dimensional and spatially organized inputs such as images. However, their
Transfer Learning (TL) properties are not yet well studied, and it is not fully
known whether these neural architectures can transfer across different domains
as well as CNNs. In this paper we study whether VTs that are pre-trained on the
popular ImageNet dataset learn representations that are transferable to the
non-natural image domain. To do so we consider three well-studied art
classification problems and use them as a surrogate for studying the TL
potential of four popular VTs. Their performance is extensively compared
against that of four common CNNs across several TL experiments. Our results
show that VTs exhibit strong generalization properties and that these networks
are more powerful feature extractors than CNNs.</p>

professors for respected courses in each academic semester. In this sense,
factors such as teaching experience, academic training, competition, etc. are
considered. This work is usually done by experts, such as faculty directors,
which is time consuming. Up to now, several semi-automatic systems have been
proposed to assist heads. In this article, a fully automatic rule-based expert
system is developed. The proposed expert system consists of three main stages.
First, the knowledge of human experts is entered and designed as a decision
tree. In the second step, an expert system is designed based on the provided
rules of the generated decision tree. In the third step, an algorithm is
proposed to weight the results of the tree based on the quality of the experts.
To improve the performance of the expert system, a majority voting algorithm is
developed as a post-process step to select the qualified trainer who satisfies
the most expert decision tree for each course. The quality of the proposed
expert system is evaluated using real data from Iranian universities. The
calculated accuracy rate is 85.55, demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of
the proposed system. The proposed system has little computational complexity
compared to related efficient works. Also, simple implementation and
transparent box are other features of the proposed system.</p>

    <p>Melanoma is a serious form of skin cancer with high mortality rate at later
stages. Fortunately, when detected early, the prognosis of melanoma is
promising and malignant melanoma incidence rates are relatively low. As a
result, datasets are heavily imbalanced which complicates training current
state-of-the-art supervised classification AI models. We propose to use
generative models to learn the benign data distribution and detect
Out-of-Distribution (OOD) malignant images through density estimation.
Normalizing Flows (NFs) are ideal candidates for OOD detection due to their
ability to compute exact likelihoods. Nevertheless, their inductive biases
towards apparent graphical features rather than semantic context hamper
accurate OOD detection. In this work, we aim at using these biases with
domain-level knowledge of melanoma, to improve likelihood-based OOD detection
of malignant images. Our encouraging results demonstrate potential for OOD
detection of melanoma using NFs. We achieve a 9\% increase in Area Under Curve
of the Receiver Operating Characteristics by using wavelet-based NFs. This
model requires significantly less parameters for inference making it more
applicable on edge devices. The proposed methodology can aid medical experts
with diagnosis of skin-cancer patients and continuously increase survival
rates. Furthermore, this research paves the way for other areas in oncology
with similar data imbalance issues\footnote{Code available at:

    <p>In this work, we propose Reciprocal Distribution Alignment (RDA) to address
semi-supervised learning (SSL), which is a hyperparameter-free framework that
is independent of confidence threshold and works with both the matched
(conventionally) and the mismatched class distributions. Distribution mismatch
is an often overlooked but more general SSL scenario where the labeled and the
unlabeled data do not fall into the identical class distribution. This may lead
to the model not exploiting the labeled data reliably and drastically degrade
the performance of SSL methods, which could not be rescued by the traditional
distribution alignment. In RDA, we enforce a reciprocal alignment on the
distributions of the predictions from two classifiers predicting pseudo-labels
and complementary labels on the unlabeled data. These two distributions,
carrying complementary information, could be utilized to regularize each other
without any prior of class distribution. Moreover, we theoretically show that
RDA maximizes the input-output mutual information. Our approach achieves
promising performance in SSL under a variety of scenarios of mismatched
distributions, as well as the conventional matched SSL setting. Our code is

    <p>With the ever-increasing electrification of the vehicle showing no sign of
retreating, electronic systems deployed in automotive applications are subject
to more stringent Electromagnetic Immunity compliance constraints than ever
before, to ensure the proximity of nearby electronic systems will not affect
their operation. The EMI compliance testing of an analog camera link requires
video quality to be monitored and assessed to validate such compliance, which
up to now, has been a manual task. Due to the nature of human interpretation,
this is open to inconsistency. Here, we propose a solution using deep learning
models that analyse, and grade video content derived from an EMI compliance
test. These models are trained using a dataset built entirely from real test
image data to ensure the accuracy of the resultant model(s) is maximised.

    <p>Monitoring seed maturity is an increasing challenge in agriculture due to
climate change and more restrictive practices. Seeds monitoring in the field is
essential to optimize the farming process and to guarantee yield quality
through high germination. Traditional methods are based on limited sampling in
the field and analysis in laboratory. Moreover, they are time consuming and
only allow monitoring sub-sections of the crop field. This leads to a lack of
accuracy on the condition of the crop as a whole due to intra-field
heterogeneities. Multispectral imagery by UAV allows uniform scan of fields and
better capture of crop maturity information. On the other hand, deep learning
methods have shown tremendous potential in estimating agronomic parameters,
especially maturity. However, they require large labeled datasets. Although
large sets of aerial images are available, labeling them with ground truth is a
tedious, if not impossible task. In this paper, we propose a method for
estimating parsley seed maturity using multispectral UAV imagery, with a new
approach for automatic data labeling. This approach is based on parametric and
non-parametric models to provide weak labels. We also consider the data
acquisition protocol and the performance evaluation of the different steps of
the method. Results show good performance, and the non-parametric kernel
density estimator model can improve neural network generalization when used as
a labeling method, leading to more robust and better performing deep neural
models.</p>

    <p>Progress in automated microscopy and quantitative image analysis has promoted
high-content screening (HCS) as an efficient drug discovery and research tool.
While HCS offers to quantify complex cellular phenotypes from images at high
throughput, this process can be obstructed by image aberrations such as
out-of-focus image blur, fluorophore saturation, debris, a high level of noise,
unexpected auto-fluorescence or empty images. While this issue has received
moderate attention in the literature, overlooking these artefacts can seriously
hamper downstream image processing tasks and hinder detection of subtle
phenotypes. It is therefore of primary concern, and a prerequisite, to use
quality control in HCS. In this work, we evaluate deep learning options that do
not require extensive image annotations to provide a straightforward and easy
to use semi-supervised learning solution to this issue. Concretely, we compared
the efficacy of recent self-supervised and transfer learning approaches to
provide a base encoder to a high throughput artefact image detector. The
results of this study suggest that transfer learning methods should be
preferred for this task as they not only performed best here but present the
advantage of not requiring sensitive hyperparameter settings nor extensive
additional training.</p>

    <p>Pruning techniques are used comprehensively to compress convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) on image classification. However, the majority of pruning
methods require a well pre-trained model to provide useful supporting
parameters, such as C1-norm, BatchNorm value and gradient information, which
may lead to inconsistency of filter evaluation if the parameters of the
pre-trained model are not well optimized. Therefore, we propose a sensitiveness
based method to evaluate the importance of each layer from the perspective of
inference accuracy by adding extra damage for the original model. Because the
performance of the accuracy is determined by the distribution of parameters
across all layers rather than individual parameter, the sensitiveness based
method will be robust to update of parameters. Namely, we can obtain similar
importance evaluation of each convolutional layer between the imperfect-trained
and fully trained models. For VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, even when the original model
is only trained with 50 epochs, we can get same evaluation of layer importance
as the results when the model is trained fully. Then we will remove filters
proportional from each layer by the quantified sensitiveness. Our sensitiveness
based pruning framework is verified efficiently on VGG-16, a customized Conv-4
and ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10, MNIST and CIFAR-100, respectively.</p>

image reconstruction and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the
discrete representations learned by HR-VQVAE enable the decoder to reconstruct
high-quality images with less distortion than the baseline methods, namely
VQVAE and VQVAE-2. HR-VQVAE can also generate high-quality and diverse images
that outperform state-of-the-art generative models, providing further
verification of the efficiency of the learned representations. The hierarchical
nature of HR-VQVAE i) reduces the decoding search time, making the method
particularly suitable for high-load tasks and ii) allows to increase the

    <p>Zebrafish is an excellent model organism, which has been widely used in the
fields of biological experiments, drug screening, and swarm intelligence. In
recent years, there are a large number of techniques for tracking of zebrafish
involved in the study of behaviors, which makes it attack much attention of
scientists from many fields. Multi-target tracking of zebrafish is still facing
many challenges. The high mobility and uncertainty make it difficult to predict
its motion; the similar appearances and texture features make it difficult to
establish an appearance model; it is even hard to link the trajectories because
of the frequent occlusion. In this paper, we use particle filter to approximate
the uncertainty of the motion. Firstly, by analyzing the motion characteristics
of zebrafish, we establish an efficient hybrid motion model to predict its
positions; then we establish an appearance model based on the predicted
positions to predict the postures of every targets, meanwhile weigh the
particles by comparing the difference of predicted pose and observation pose ;
finally, we get the optimal position of single zebrafish through the weighted
position, and use the joint particle filter to process trajectory linking of

    <p>In recent years, virtual learning has emerged as an alternative to
traditional classroom teaching. The engagement of students in virtual learning
can have a major impact on meeting learning objectives and program dropout
risks. There exist many measurement instruments specifically geared to Student
Engagement (SE) in virtual learning environments. In this critical review, we
analyze these works and highlight inconsistencies in terms of differing
engagement definitions and measurement scales. This diversity among existing
researchers could potentially be problematic in comparing different annotations
and building generalizable predictive models. We further discuss issues in
terms of engagement annotations and design flaws. We analyze the existing SE
annotation scales based on our defined seven dimensions of engagement
annotation, including sources, data modalities used for annotation, the time
when the annotation takes place, the timesteps in which the annotation takes
place, level of abstraction, combination, and quantification. One of the
surprising findings was that very few of the reviewed datasets on SE
measurement used existing psychometrically validated engagement scales in their
annotation. Lastly, we discuss some other scales in settings other than virtual
learning that have the potential to be used in measuring SE in virtual
learning.</p>

    <p>Predicting future behaviors of road agents is a key task in autonomous
driving. While existing models have demonstrated great success in predicting
marginal agent future behaviors, it remains a challenge to efficiently predict
consistent joint behaviors of multiple agents. Recently, the occupancy flow
fields representation was proposed to represent joint future states of road
agents through a combination of occupancy grid and flow, which supports
efficient and consistent joint predictions. In this work, we propose a novel
occupancy flow fields predictor to produce accurate occupancy and flow
predictions, by combining the power of an image encoder that learns features
from a rasterized traffic image and a vector encoder that captures information
of continuous agent trajectories and map states. The two encoded features are
fused by multiple attention modules before generating final predictions. Our
simple but effective model ranks 3rd place on the Waymo Open Dataset Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge, and achieves the best performance in the
occluded occupancy and flow prediction task.</p>

    <p>Image aesthetic quality assessment is popular during the last decade. Besides
numerical assessment, nature language assessment (aesthetic captioning) has
been proposed to describe the generally aesthetic impression of an image. In
this paper, we propose aesthetic attribute assessment, which is the aesthetic
attributes captioning, i.e., to assess the aesthetic attributes such as
composition, lighting usage and color arrangement. It is a non-trivial task to
label the comments of aesthetic attributes, which limit the scale of the
corresponding datasets. We construct a novel dataset, named DPC-CaptionsV2, by
a semi-automatic way. The knowledge is transferred from a small-scale dataset
with full annotations to large-scale professional comments from a photography
website. Images of DPC-CaptionsV2 contain comments up to 4 aesthetic
attributes: composition, lighting, color, and subject. Then, we propose a new
version of Aesthetic Multi-Attributes Networks (AMANv2) based on the BUTD model
and the VLPSA model. AMANv2 fuses features of a mixture of small-scale PCCD
dataset with full annotations and large-scale DPCCaptionsV2 dataset with full
annotations. The experimental results of DPCCaptionsV2 show that our method can
predict the comments on 4 aesthetic attributes, which are closer to aesthetic
topics than those produced by the previous AMAN model. Through the evaluation
criteria of image captioning, the specially designed AMANv2 model is better to
the CNN-LSTM model and the AMAN model.</p>

    <p>In recent years, image generation has made great strides in improving the
quality of images, producing high-fidelity ones. Also, quite recently, there
are architecture designs, which enable GAN to unsupervisedly learn the semantic
attributes represented in different layers. However, there is still a lack of
research on generating face images more consistent with human aesthetics. Based
on EigenGAN [He et al., ICCV 2021], we build the techniques of reinforcement
learning into the generator of EigenGAN. The agent tries to figure out how to
alter the semantic attributes of the generated human faces towards more
preferable ones. To accomplish this, we trained an aesthetics scoring model
that can conduct facial beauty prediction. We also can utilize this scoring
model to analyze the correlation between face attributes and aesthetics scores.
Empirically, using off-the-shelf techniques from reinforcement learning would
not work well. So instead, we present a new variant incorporating the
ingredients emerging in the reinforcement learning communities in recent years.
Compared to the original generated images, the adjusted ones show clear
distinctions concerning various attributes. Experimental results using the
MindSpore, show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Altered facial images
are commonly more attractive, with significantly improved aesthetic levels.</p>

    <p>Unsupervised domain adaptation for point cloud semantic segmentation has
attracted great attention due to its effectiveness in learning with unlabeled
data. Most of existing methods use global-level feature alignment to transfer
the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, which may cause the
semantic ambiguity of the feature space. In this paper, we propose a
graph-based framework to explore the local-level feature alignment between the
two domains, which can reserve semantic discrimination during adaptation.
Specifically, in order to extract local-level features, we first dynamically
construct local feature graphs on both domains and build a memory bank with the
graphs from the source domain. In particular, we use optimal transport to
generate the graph matching pairs. Then, based on the assignment matrix, we can
align the feature distributions between the two domains with the graph-based
local feature loss. Furthermore, we consider the correlation between the
features of different categories and formulate a category-guided contrastive
loss to guide the segmentation model to learn discriminative features on the
target domain. Extensive experiments on different synthetic-to-real and
real-to-real domain adaptation scenarios demonstrate that our method can
achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p>

    <p>Lip reading aims to predict speech based on lip movements alone. As it
focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is
inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements. This makes the
lip reading models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen
speakers due to the mismatch between training and testing conditions. Speaker
adaptation technique aims to reduce this mismatch between train and test
speakers, thus guiding a trained model to focus on modeling the speech content
without being intervened by the speaker variations. In contrast to the efforts
made in audio-based speech recognition for decades, the speaker adaptation
methods have not well been studied in lip reading. In this paper, to remedy the
performance degradation of lip reading model on unseen speakers, we propose a
speaker-adaptive lip reading method, namely user-dependent padding. The
user-dependent padding is a speaker-specific input that can participate in the
visual feature extraction stage of a pre-trained lip reading model. Therefore,
the lip appearances and movements information of different speakers can be
considered during the visual feature encoding, adaptively for individual
speakers. Moreover, the proposed method does not need 1) any additional layers,
2) to modify the learned weights of the pre-trained model, and 3) the speaker
label of train data used during pre-train. It can directly adapt to unseen
speakers by learning the user-dependent padding only, in a supervised or
unsupervised manner. Finally, to alleviate the speaker information
insufficiency in public lip reading databases, we label the speaker of a
well-known audio-visual database, LRW, and design an unseen-speaker lip reading
scenario named LRW-ID.</p>

vital for localizing the gaze fixation from egocentric video frames. To this
end, we design the transformer encoder to embed the global context as one
additional visual token and further propose a novel Global-Local Correlation
(GLC) module to explicitly model the correlation of the global token and each
local token. We validate our model on two egocentric video datasets - EGTEA
Gaze+ and Ego4D. Our detailed ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of our
method. In addition, our approach exceeds previous state-of-the-arts by a large

    <p>We introduce NeuralVDB, which improves on an existing industry standard for
efficient storage of sparse volumetric data, denoted VDB, by leveraging recent
advancements in machine learning. Our novel hybrid data structure can reduce
the memory footprints of VDB volumes by orders of magnitude, while maintaining
its flexibility and only incurring a small (user-controlled) compression
errors. Specifically, NeuralVDB replaces the lower nodes of a shallow and wide
VDB tree structure with multiple hierarchy neural networks that separately
encode topology and value information by means of neural classifiers and
regressors respectively. This approach has proven to maximize the compression
ratio while maintaining the spatial adaptivity offered by the higher-level VDB
data structure. For sparse signed distance fields and density volumes, we have
observed compression ratios on the order of $10\times$ to more than $100\times$
from already compressed VDB inputs, with little to no visual artifacts. We also
demonstrate how its application to animated sparse volumes can both accelerate
training and generate temporally coherent neural networks.</p>

    <p>The synthesis of high-resolution remote sensing images based on text
descriptions has great potential in many practical application scenarios.
Although deep neural networks have achieved great success in many important
remote sensing tasks, generating realistic remote sensing images from text
descriptions is still very difficult. To address this challenge, we propose a
novel text-to-image modern Hopfield network (Txt2Img-MHN). The main idea of
Txt2Img-MHN is to conduct hierarchical prototype learning on both text and
image embeddings with modern Hopfield layers. Instead of directly learning
concrete but highly diverse text-image joint feature representations for
different semantics, Txt2Img-MHN aims to learn the most representative
prototypes from text-image embeddings, achieving a coarse-to-fine learning
strategy. These learned prototypes can then be utilized to represent more
complex semantics in the text-to-image generation task. To better evaluate the
realism and semantic consistency of the generated images, we further conduct
zero-shot classification on real remote sensing data using the classification
model trained on synthesized images. Despite its simplicity, we find that the
overall accuracy in the zero-shot classification may serve as a good metric to
evaluate the ability to generate an image from text. Extensive experiments on
the benchmark remote sensing text-image dataset demonstrate that the proposed
Txt2Img-MHN can generate more realistic remote sensing images than existing
methods. Code and pre-trained models are available online

    <p>Segmenting highly-overlapping image objects is challenging, because there is
typically no distinction between real object contours and occlusion boundaries
on images. Unlike previous instance segmentation methods, we model image
formation as a composition of two overlapping layers, and propose Bilayer
Convolutional Network (BCNet), where the top layer detects occluding objects
(occluders) and the bottom layer infers partially occluded instances
(occludees). The explicit modeling of occlusion relationship with bilayer
structure naturally decouples the boundaries of both the occluding and occluded
instances, and considers the interaction between them during mask regression.
We investigate the efficacy of bilayer structure using two popular
convolutional network designs, namely, Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) and
Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). Further, we formulate bilayer decoupling
using the vision transformer (ViT), by representing instances in the image as
separate learnable occluder and occludee queries. Large and consistent
improvements using one/two-stage and query-based object detectors with various
backbones and network layer choices validate the generalization ability of
bilayer decoupling, as shown by extensive experiments on image instance
segmentation benchmarks (COCO, KINS, COCOA) and video instance segmentation
benchmarks (YTVIS, OVIS, BDD100K MOTS), especially for heavy occlusion cases.

fourfold. Firstly, we present a new formulation of pseudo-labelling as an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clear statistical interpretation.
Secondly, we propose a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method purely
based on the original pseudo labelling, namely SegPL. We demonstrate SegPL is a
competitive approach against state-of-the-art consistency regularisation based
methods on semi-supervised segmentation on a 2D multi-class MRI brain tumour
segmentation task and a 3D binary CT lung vessel segmentation task. The
simplicity of SegPL allows less computational cost comparing to prior methods.
Thirdly, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of SegPL may originate from its
robustness against out-of-distribution noises and adversarial attacks. Lastly,
under the EM framework, we introduce a probabilistic generalisation of SegPL
via variational inference, which learns a dynamic threshold for pseudo
labelling during the training. We show that SegPL with variational inference
can perform uncertainty estimation on par with the gold-standard method Deep

    <p>Video-based remote physiological measurement utilizes face videos to measure
the blood volume change signal, which is also called remote
photoplethysmography (rPPG). Supervised methods for rPPG measurements achieve
state-of-the-art performance. However, supervised rPPG methods require face
videos and ground truth physiological signals for model training. In this
paper, we propose an unsupervised rPPG measurement method that does not require
ground truth signals for training. We use a 3DCNN model to generate multiple
rPPG signals from each video in different spatiotemporal locations and train
the model with a contrastive loss where rPPG signals from the same video are
pulled together while those from different videos are pushed away. We test on
five public datasets, including RGB videos and NIR videos. The results show
that our method outperforms the previous unsupervised baseline and achieves
accuracies very close to the current best supervised rPPG methods on all five
datasets. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that our approach can run at a much

    <p>Nondestructive testing (NDT) is widely applied to defect identification of
turbine components during manufacturing and operation. Operational efficiency
is key for gas turbine OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturers). Automating the
inspection process as much as possible, while minimizing the uncertainties
involved, is thus crucial. We propose a model based on RetinaNet to identify
drilling defects in X-ray images of turbine blades. The application is
challenging due to the large image resolutions in which defects are very small
and hardly captured by the commonly used anchor sizes, and also due to the
small size of the available dataset. As a matter of fact, all these issues are
pretty common in the application of Deep Learning-based object detection models
to industrial defect data. We overcome such issues using open source models,
splitting the input images into tiles and scaling them up, applying heavy data
augmentation, and optimizing the anchor size and aspect ratios with a
differential evolution solver. We validate the model with $3$-fold
cross-validation, showing a very high accuracy in identifying images with
defects. We also define a set of best practices which can help other

    <p>Learning robust feature representation from large-scale noisy faces stands
out as one of the key challenges in high-performance face recognition. Recent
attempts have been made to cope with this challenge by alleviating the
intra-class conflict and inter-class conflict. However, the unconstrained noise
type in each conflict still makes it difficult for these algorithms to perform
well. To better understand this, we reformulate the noise type of each class in
a more fine-grained manner as N-identities|K^C-clusters. Different types of
noisy faces can be generated by adjusting the values of \nkc. Based on this
unified formulation, we found that the main barrier behind the noise-robust
representation learning is the flexibility of the algorithm under different N,
K, and C. For this potential problem, we propose a new method, named Evolving
Sub-centers Learning~(ESL), to find optimal hyperplanes to accurately describe
the latent space of massive noisy faces. More specifically, we initialize M
sub-centers for each class and ESL encourages it to be automatically aligned to
N-identities|K^C-clusters faces via producing, merging, and dropping
operations. Images belonging to the same identity in noisy faces can
effectively converge to the same sub-center and samples with different
identities will be pushed away. We inspect its effectiveness with an elaborate
ablation study on the synthetic noisy dataset with different N, K, and C.
Without any bells and whistles, ESL can achieve significant performance gains
over state-of-the-art methods on large-scale noisy faces</p>

    <p>Images captured in real-world applications in remote sensing, image or video
retrieval, and outdoor surveillance suffer degraded quality introduced by poor
weather conditions. Conditions such as rain and mist, introduce artifacts that
make visual analysis challenging and limit the performance of high-level
computer vision methods. For time-critical applications where a rapid response
is necessary, it becomes crucial to develop algorithms that automatically
remove rain, without diminishing the quality of the image contents. This
article aims to develop a novel quaternion multi-stage multiscale neural
network with a self-attention module called QSAM-Net to remove rain streaks.
The novelty of this algorithm is that it requires significantly fewer
parameters by a factor of 3.98, over prior methods, while improving visual
quality. This is demonstrated by the extensive evaluation and benchmarking on
synthetic and real-world rainy images. This feature of QSAM-Net makes the
network suitable for implementation on edge devices and applications requiring

    <p>The ongoing advancements in network architecture design have led to
remarkable achievements in deep learning across various challenging computer
vision tasks. Meanwhile, the development of neural architecture search (NAS)
has provided promising approaches to automating the design of network
architectures for lower prediction error. Recently, the emerging application
scenarios of deep learning have raised higher demands for network architectures
considering multiple design criteria: number of parameters/floating-point
operations, and inference latency, among others. From an optimization point of
view, the NAS tasks involving multiple design criteria are intrinsically
multiobjective optimization problems; hence, it is reasonable to adopt
evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithms for tackling them.
Nonetheless, there is still a clear gap confining the related research along
this pathway: on the one hand, there is a lack of a general problem formulation
of NAS tasks from an optimization point of view; on the other hand, there are
challenges in conducting benchmark assessments of EMO algorithms on NAS tasks.
To bridge the gap: (i) we formulate NAS tasks into general multi-objective
optimization problems and analyze the complex characteristics from an
optimization point of view; (ii) we present an end-to-end pipeline, dubbed
$\texttt{EvoXBench}$, to generate benchmark test problems for EMO algorithms to
run efficiently -- without the requirement of GPUs or Pytorch/Tensorflow; (iii)
we instantiate two test suites comprehensively covering two datasets, seven
search spaces, and three hardware devices, involving up to eight objectives.
Based on the above, we validate the proposed test suites using six
representative EMO algorithms and provide some empirical analyses. The code of
$\texttt{EvoXBench}$ is available from

    <p>Missing scans are inevitable in longitudinal studies due to either subject
dropouts or failed scans. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework
to predict missing scans from acquired scans, catering to longitudinal infant
studies. Prediction of infant brain MRI is challenging owing to the rapid
contrast and structural changes particularly during the first year of life. We
introduce a trustworthy metamorphic generative adversarial network (MGAN) for
translating infant brain MRI from one time-point to another. MGAN has three key
features: (i) Image translation leveraging spatial and frequency information
for detail-preserving mapping; (ii) Quality-guided learning strategy that
focuses attention on challenging regions. (iii) Multi-scale hybrid loss
function that improves translation of tissue contrast and structural details.
Experimental results indicate that MGAN outperforms existing GANs by accurately
predicting both contrast and anatomical details.</p>

    <p>COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread rapidly over the world and causes a
tremendous crisis in global human health and the economy. Its early detection
and diagnosis are crucial for controlling the further spread. Many deep
learning-based methods have been proposed to assist clinicians in automatic
COVID-19 diagnosis based on computed tomography imaging. However, challenges
still remain, including low data diversity in existing datasets, and
unsatisfied detection resulting from insufficient accuracy and sensitivity of
deep learning models. To enhance the data diversity, we design augmentation
techniques of incremental levels and apply them to the largest open-access
benchmark dataset, COVIDx CT-2A. Meanwhile, similarity regularization (SR)
derived from contrastive learning is proposed in this study to enable CNNs to
learn more parameter-efficient representations, thus improving the accuracy and
sensitivity of CNNs. The results on seven commonly used CNNs demonstrate that
CNN performance can be improved stably through applying the designed
augmentation and SR techniques. In particular, DenseNet121 with SR achieves an
average test accuracy of 99.44% in three trials for three-category
classification, including normal, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and COVID-19
pneumonia. And the achieved precision, sensitivity, and specificity for the
COVID-19 pneumonia category are 98.40%, 99.59%, and 99.50%, respectively. These
statistics suggest that our method has surpassed the existing state-of-the-art

    <p>Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) typically grows from the inner ear to the brain.
It can be separated into two regions, intrameatal and extrameatal respectively
corresponding to being inside or outside the inner ear canal. The growth of the
extrameatal regions is a key factor that determines the disease management
followed by the clinicians. In this work, a VS segmentation approach with
subdivision into intra-/extra-meatal parts is presented. We annotated a dataset
consisting of 227 T2 MRI instances, acquired longitudinally on 137 patients,
excluding post-operative instances. We propose a staged approach, with the
first stage performing the whole tumour segmentation and the second stage
performing the intra-/extra-meatal segmentation using the T2 MRI along with the
mask obtained from the first stage. To improve on the accuracy of the predicted
meatal boundary, we introduce a task-specific loss which we call Boundary
Distance Loss. The performance is evaluated in contrast to the direct
intrameatal extrameatal segmentation task performance, i.e. the Baseline. Our
proposed method, with the two-stage approach and the Boundary Distance Loss,
achieved a Dice score of 0.8279+-0.2050 and 0.7744+-0.1352 for extrameatal and
intrameatal regions respectively, significantly improving over the Baseline,
which gave Dice score of 0.7939+-0.2325 and 0.7475+-0.1346 for the extrameatal

    <p>When imaging through a semi-reflective medium such as glass, the reflection
of another scene can often be found in the captured images. It degrades the
quality of the images and affects their subsequent analyses. In this paper, a
novel deep neural network approach for solving the reflection problem in
imaging is presented. Traditional reflection removal methods not only require
long computation time for solving different optimization functions, their
performance is also not guaranteed. As array cameras are readily available in
nowadays imaging devices, we first suggest in this paper a multiple-image based
depth estimation method using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The
proposed network avoids the depth ambiguity problem due to the reflection in
the image, and directly estimates the depths along the image edges. They are
then used to classify the edges as belonging to the background or reflection.
Since edges having similar depth values are error prone in the classification,
they are removed from the reflection removal process. We suggest a generative
adversarial network (GAN) to regenerate the removed background edges. Finally,
the estimated background edge map is fed to another auto-encoder network to
assist the extraction of the background from the original image. Experimental
results show that the proposed reflection removal algorithm achieves superior
performance both quantitatively and qualitatively as compared to the
state-of-the-art methods. The proposed algorithm also shows much faster speed
compared to the existing approaches using the traditional optimization methods.</p>

    <p>Convolution neural network (CNN) based methods offer effective solutions for
enhancing the quality of compressed image and video. However, these methods
ignore using the raw data to enhance the quality. In this paper, we adopt the
raw data in the quality enhancement for the HEVC intra-coded image by proposing
an online learning-based method. When quality enhancement is demanded, we
online train our proposed model at encoder side and then use the parameters to
update the model of decoder side. This method not only improves model
performance, but also makes one model adoptable to multiple coding scenarios.
Besides, quantization error in discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients is
the root cause of various HEVC compression artifacts. Thus, we combine
frequency domain priors to assist image reconstruction. We design a DCT based
convolution layer, to produce DCT coefficients that are suitable for CNN
learning. Experimental results show that our proposed online learning based
dual-domain network (OL-DN) has achieved superior performance, compared with
the state-of-the-art methods.</p>

    <p>Recently, change detection methods for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images
based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) have gained increasing research
attention. However, existing CNN-based methods neglect the interactions among
multilayer convolutions, and errors involved in the preclassification restrict
the network optimization. To this end, we proposed a layer attention-based
noise-tolerant network, termed LANTNet. In particular, we design a layer
attention module that adaptively weights the feature of different convolution
layers. In addition, we design a noise-tolerant loss function that effectively
suppresses the impact of noisy labels. Therefore, the model is insensitive to
noisy labels in the preclassification results. The experimental results on
three SAR datasets show that the proposed LANTNet performs better compared to

    <p>Image representation is critical for many visual tasks. Instead of
representing images discretely with 2D arrays of pixels, a recent study, namely
local implicit image function (LIIF), denotes images as a continuous function
where pixel values are expansion by using the corresponding coordinates as
inputs. Due to its continuous nature, LIIF can be adopted for arbitrary-scale
image super-resolution tasks, resulting in a single effective and efficient
model for various up-scaling factors. However, LIIF often suffers from
structural distortions and ringing artifacts around edges, mostly because all
pixels share the same model, thus ignoring the local properties of the image.
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive local image function (A-LIIF) to
alleviate this problem. Specifically, our A-LIIF consists of two main
components: an encoder and a expansion network. The former captures cross-scale
image features, while the latter models the continuous up-scaling function by a
weighted combination of multiple local implicit image functions. Accordingly,
our A-LIIF can reconstruct the high-frequency textures and structures more
accurately. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness
of our method. Our codes are available at

    <p>Responsive teaching is a highly effective strategy that promotes student
learning. In math classrooms, teachers might "funnel" students towards a
normative answer or "focus" students to reflect on their own thinking,
deepening their understanding of math concepts. When teachers focus, they treat
students' contributions as resources for collective sensemaking, and thereby
significantly improve students' achievement and confidence in mathematics. We
propose the task of computationally detecting funneling and focusing questions
in classroom discourse. We do so by creating and releasing an annotated dataset
of 2,348 teacher utterances labeled for funneling and focusing questions, or
neither. We introduce supervised and unsupervised approaches to differentiating
these questions. Our best model, a supervised RoBERTa model fine-tuned on our
dataset, has a strong linear correlation of .76 with human expert labels and
with positive educational outcomes, including math instruction quality and
student achievement, showing the model's potential for use in automated teacher
feedback tools. Our unsupervised measures show significant but weaker
correlations with human labels and outcomes, and they highlight interesting

    <p>Error correction techniques remain effective to refine outputs from automatic

based on an encoder-decoder architecture process all tokens in the decoding
phase, creating undesirable latency. In this paper, we propose an ASR error
correction method utilizing the predictions of correction operations. More
specifically, we construct a predictor between the encoder and the decoder to
learn if a token should be kept ("K"), deleted ("D"), or changed ("C") to
restrict decoding to only part of the input sequence embeddings (the "C"
tokens) for fast inference. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the latency of the
decoding process in ASR correction. It enhances the inference speed by at least
three times (3.4 and 5.7 times) while maintaining the same level of accuracy
(with WER reductions of 0.53% and 1.69% respectively) for our two proposed
models compared to a solid encoder-decoder baseline. In the meantime, we
produce and release a benchmark dataset contributing to the ASR error
correction community to foster research along this line.</p>

in their representation in the field. However, most studies tend to focus more
on the models than the quality of the datasets when assessing the models'
performance in tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). While this works
well in most cases, it does not account for the limitations of doing NLP with
low-resource languages, that is, the quality and the quantity of the dataset at
our disposal. This paper provides an analysis of the performance of various
models based on the quality of the dataset. We evaluate different pre-trained
models with respect to the entity density per sentence of some African NER
datasets. We hope with this study to improve the way NLP studies are done in
the context of low-resourced languages.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we describe a data-driven approach for developing Emily, an
emotion-affective open-domain chatbot. The proposed data enhancing method can
explicitly model positively transitioned (PT) sentiment data from multi-turn
dialogues. We construct a dialogue corpus with PT sentiment data and will
release it for public use. By fine-tuning a pretrained dialogue model using the
produced PT enhanced dialogues, we are able to develop an emotion-affective
open-domain chatbot exhibiting close-to-human performance in various
emotion-affective metrics. We evaluate Emily against a few state-of-the-art
(SOTA) open-domain chatbots and show the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.</p>

    <p>Data-to-text (D2T) generation is the task of generating texts from structured
inputs. We observed that when the same target sentence was repeated twice,
Transformer (T5) based model generates an output made up of asymmetric
sentences from structured inputs. In other words, these sentences were
different in length and quality. We call this phenomenon "Asymmetric
Generation" and we exploit this in D2T generation. Once asymmetric sentences
are generated, we add the first part of the output with a no-repeated-target.
As this goes through progressive edit (ProEdit), the recall increases. Hence,
this method better covers structured inputs than before editing. ProEdit is a
simple but effective way to improve performance in D2T generation and it
achieves the new stateof-the-art result on the ToTTo dataset</p>

    <p>Named entity recognition (NER) is the task to detect and classify the entity
spans in the text. When entity spans overlap between each other, this problem
is named as nested NER. Span-based methods have been widely used to tackle the
nested NER. Most of these methods will get a score $n \times n$ matrix, where
$n$ means the length of sentence, and each entry corresponds to a span.
However, previous work ignores spatial relations in the score matrix. In this
paper, we propose using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to model these
spatial relations in the score matrix. Despite being simple, experiments in
three commonly used nested NER datasets show that our model surpasses several
recently proposed methods with the same pre-trained encoders. Further analysis
shows that using CNN can help the model find nested entities more accurately.
Besides, we found that different papers used different sentence tokenizations
for the three nested NER datasets, which will influence the comparison. Thus,
we release a pre-processing script to facilitate future comparison.</p>

    <p>Hate Speech takes many forms to target communities with derogatory comments,
and takes humanity a step back in societal progress. HateXplain is a recently
published and first dataset to use annotated spans in the form of rationales,
along with speech classification categories and targeted communities to make
the classification more humanlike, explainable, accurate and less biased. We
tune BERT to perform this task in the form of rationales and class prediction,
and compare our performance on different metrics spanning across accuracy,
explainability and bias. Our novelty is threefold. Firstly, we experiment with
the amalgamated rationale class loss with different importance values.
Secondly, we experiment extensively with the ground truth attention values for
the rationales. With the introduction of conservative and lenient attentions,
we compare performance of the model on HateXplain and test our hypothesis.
Thirdly, in order to improve the unintended bias in our models, we use masking
of the target community words and note the improvement in bias and
explainability metrics. Overall, we are successful in achieving model
explanability, bias removal and several incremental improvements on the
original BERT implementation.</p>

found only the weakest bias in the more recent Instruct Series version of
GPT-3, fine-tuned to eliminate biased and toxic outputs. Few violent
completions were observed. Additional pre-registered experiments, however,
showed that using common names associated with the religions in prompts yields
a highly significant increase in violent completions, also revealing a stronger
second-order bias against Muslims. Names of Muslim celebrities from non-violent
domains resulted in relatively fewer violent completions, suggesting that
access to individualized information can steer the model away from using
stereotypes. Nonetheless, content analysis revealed religion-specific violent
themes containing highly offensive ideas regardless of prompt format. Our
results show the need for additional debiasing of large language models to

    <p>With the future striving toward data-centric decision-making, seamless access
to databases is of utmost importance. There is extensive research on creating
an efficient text-to-sql (TEXT2SQL) model to access data from the database.
Using a Natural language is one of the best interfaces that can bridge the gap
between the data and results by accessing the database efficiently, especially
for non-technical users. It will open the doors and create tremendous interest
among users who are well versed in technical skills or not very skilled in
query languages. Even if numerous deep learning-based algorithms are proposed
or studied, there still is very challenging to have a generic model to solve
the data query issues using natural language in a real-work scenario. The
reason is the use of different datasets in different studies, which comes with
its limitations and assumptions. At the same time, we do lack a thorough
understanding of these proposed models and their limitations with the specific
dataset it is trained on. In this paper, we try to present a holistic overview
of 24 recent neural network models studied in the last couple of years,
including their architectures involving convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, pointer networks, reinforcement learning, generative
models, etc. We also give an overview of the 11 datasets that are widely used
to train the models for TEXT2SQL technologies. We also discuss the future

    <p>Recent progress on neural approaches for language processing has triggered a
resurgence of interest on building intelligent open-domain chatbots. However,
even the state-of-the-art neural chatbots cannot produce satisfying responses
for every turn in a dialog. A practical solution is to generate multiple
response candidates for the same context, and then perform response
ranking/selection to determine which candidate is the best. Previous work in
response selection typically trains response rankers using synthetic data that
is formed from existing dialogs by using a ground truth response as the single
appropriate response and constructing inappropriate responses via random
selection or using adversarial methods. In this work, we curated a dataset
where responses from multiple response generators produced for the same dialog
context are manually annotated as appropriate (positive) and inappropriate
(negative). We argue that such training data better matches the actual use case
examples, enabling the models to learn to rank responses effectively. With this
new dataset, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art methods for
response selection, and demonstrate that both strategies of using multiple
positive candidates and using manually verified hard negative candidates can
bring in significant performance improvement in comparison to using the
adversarial training data, e.g., increase of 3% and 13% in Recall@1 score,
respectively.</p>

    <p>While large pretrained Transformer models have proven highly capable at
tackling natural language tasks, handling long sequence inputs continues to be
a significant challenge. One such task is long input summarization, where
inputs are longer than the maximum input context of most pretrained models.
Through an extensive set of experiments, we investigate what model
architectural changes and pretraining paradigms can most efficiently adapt a
pretrained Transformer for long input summarization. We find that a staggered,
block-local Transformer with global encoder tokens strikes a good balance of
performance and efficiency, and that an additional pretraining phase on long
sequences meaningfully improves downstream summarization performance. Based on
our findings, we introduce PEGASUS-X, an extension of the PEGASUS model with
additional long input pretraining to handle inputs of up to 16K tokens.
PEGASUS-X achieves strong performance on long input summarization tasks
comparable with much larger models while adding few additional parameters and
not requiring model parallelism to train.</p>

    <p>This paper proposes a Bayesian model to compare multiple algorithms on
multiple data sets, on any metric. The model is based on the Bradley-Terry
model, that counts the number of times one algorithm performs better than
another on different data sets. Because of its Bayesian foundations, the
Bayesian Bradley Terry model (BBT) has different characteristics than
frequentist approaches to comparing multiple algorithms on multiple data sets,
such as Demsar (2006) tests on mean rank, and Benavoli et al. (2016) multiple
pairwise Wilcoxon tests with p-adjustment procedures. In particular, a Bayesian
approach allows for more nuanced statements regarding the algorithms beyond
claiming that the difference is or it is not statistically significant.
Bayesian approaches also allow to define when two algorithms are equivalent for
practical purposes, or the region of practical equivalence (ROPE). Different
than a Bayesian signed rank comparison procedure proposed by Benavoli et al.
(2017), our approach can define a ROPE for any metric, since it is based on
probability statements, and not on differences of that metric. This paper also
proposes a local ROPE concept, that evaluates whether a positive difference
between a mean measure across some cross validation to the mean of some other
algorithms is should be really seen as the first algorithm being better than
the second, based on effect sizes. This local ROPE proposal is independent of a
Bayesian use, and can be used in frequentist approaches based on ranks. A R
package and a Python program that implements the BBT is available.</p>

    <p>Efficiently modeling long-range dependencies is an important goal in sequence
modeling. Recently, models using structured state space sequence (S4) layers
achieved state-of-the-art performance on many long-range tasks. The S4 layer
combines linear state space models (SSMs) with deep learning techniques and
leverages the HiPPO framework for online function approximation to achieve high
performance. However, this framework led to architectural constraints and
computational difficulties that make the S4 approach complicated to understand
and implement. We revisit the idea that closely following the HiPPO framework
is necessary for high performance. Specifically, we replace the bank of many
independent single-input, single-output (SISO) SSMs the S4 layer uses with one
multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) SSM with a reduced latent dimension. The
reduced latent dimension of the MIMO system allows for the use of efficient
parallel scans which simplify the computations required to apply the S5 layer
as a sequence-to-sequence transformation. In addition, we initialize the state
matrix of the S5 SSM with an approximation to the HiPPO-LegS matrix used by
S4's SSMs and show that this serves as an effective initialization for the MIMO
setting. S5 matches S4's performance on long-range tasks, including achieving
an average of 82.46% on the suite of Long Range Arena benchmarks compared to
S4's 80.48% and the best transformer variant's 61.41%.</p>

    <p>Neural networks are universal function approximators which are known to
generalize well despite being dramatically overparameterized. We study this
phenomenon from the point of view of the spectral bias of neural networks. Our
contributions are two-fold. First, we provide a theoretical explanation for the
spectral bias of ReLU neural networks by leveraging connections with the theory
of finite element methods. Second, based upon this theory we predict that
switching the activation function to a piecewise linear B-spline, namely the
Hat function, will remove this spectral bias, which we verify empirically in a
variety of settings. Our empirical studies also show that neural networks with
the Hat activation function are trained significantly faster using stochastic
gradient descent and ADAM. Combined with previous work showing that the Hat
activation function also improves generalization accuracy on image
classification tasks, this indicates that using the Hat activation provides
significant advantages over the ReLU on certain problems.</p>

    <p>This paper addresses the problem of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) --
inferring the reward function of an agent from observing its behavior. IRL can
provide a generalizable and compact representation for apprenticeship learning,
and enable accurately inferring the preferences of a human in order to assist
them. %and provide for more accurate prediction. However, effective IRL is
challenging, because many reward functions can be compatible with an observed
behavior. We focus on how prior reinforcement learning (RL) experience can be
leveraged to make learning these preferences faster and more efficient. We
propose the IRL algorithm BASIS (Behavior Acquisition through Successor-feature
Intention inference from Samples), which leverages multi-task RL pre-training
and successor features to allow an agent to build a strong basis for intentions
that spans the space of possible goals in a given domain. When exposed to just
a few expert demonstrations optimizing a novel goal, the agent uses its basis
to quickly and effectively infer the reward function. Our experiments reveal
that our method is highly effective at inferring and optimizing demonstrated
reward functions, accurately inferring reward functions from less than 100

    <p>Interstellar objects (ISOs), astronomical objects not gravitationally bound
to the Sun, are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in
understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits
with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring
ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly
challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based
guidance and control framework for encountering any fast-moving objects,
including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real-time. It uses
pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by
a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are
tuned with a newly introduced loss function directly penalizing the state
trajectory tracking error. We rigorously show that, even in the challenging
case of ISO exploration, Neural-Rendezvous provides 1) a high probability
exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error; and 2) a finite
optimality gap with respect to the solution of model predictive control, both
of which are indispensable especially for such a critical space mission. In
numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to achieve a
terminal-time delivery error of less than 0.2 km for 99% of the ISO candidates
with realistic state uncertainty, whilst retaining computational efficiency
sufficient for real-time implementation.</p>

    <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) reach high accuracies in various
application domains, but require large amounts of computation and incur costly
data movements. One method to decrease these costs while trading accuracy is
weight and/or activation word-length reduction. Thereby, layer-wise
mixed-precision quantization allows for more efficient results while inflating
the design space. In this work, we present an in-depth quantitative methodology
to efficiently explore the design space considering the limited hardware
resources of a given FPGA. Our holistic exploration approach vertically
traverses the various design entry levels from the architectural down to the
logic level, and laterally covers optimization from processing elements to
dataflow for an efficient mixed-precision CNN accelerator. Our resulting
hardware accelerators implement truly mixed-precision operations that enable
efficient execution of layer-wise and channel-wise quantized CNNs. Mapping
feed-forward and identity-shortcut-connection mixed-precision CNNs result in
competitive accuracy-throughout trade-offs: 245 frames/s with 87.48% Top-5
accuracy for ResNet-18 and 92.9% Top-5 accuracy with 1.13 TOps/s for

    <p>Large quantifies of online user activity data, such as weekly web search

propose FluxCube, which is an effective mining method that forecasts large
collections of co-evolving online user activity and provides good
interpretability. Our model is the expansion of a combination of two
mathematical models: a reaction-diffusion system provides a framework for
modeling the flow of influences between local area groups and an ecological
system models the latent interactions between each query. Also, by leveraging
the concept of physics-informed neural networks, FluxCube achieves high
interpretability obtained from the parameters and high forecasting performance,
together. Extensive experiments on real datasets showed that FluxCube
outperforms comparable models in terms of the forecasting accuracy, and each
component in FluxCube contributes to the enhanced performance. We then show
some case studies that FluxCube can extract useful latent interactions between
queries and area groups.</p>

    <p>The initial years of an infant's life are known as the critical period,
during which the overall development of learning performance is significantly
impacted due to neural plasticity. In recent studies, an AI agent, with a deep
neural network mimicking mechanisms of actual neurons, exhibited a learning
period similar to human's critical period. Especially during this initial
period, the appropriate stimuli play a vital role in developing learning
ability. However, transforming human cognitive bias into an appropriate shaping
reward is quite challenging, and prior works on critical period do not focus on
finding the appropriate stimulus. To take a step further, we propose
multi-stage reinforcement learning to emphasize finding ``appropriate stimulus"
around the critical period. Inspired by humans' early cognitive-developmental
stage, we use multi-stage guidance near the critical period, and demonstrate
the appropriate shaping reward (stage-2 guidance) in terms of the AI agent's
performance, efficiency, and stability.</p>

    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>
    <p>Learning a control policy that involves time-varying and evolving system
dynamics often poses a great challenge to mainstream reinforcement learning
algorithms. In most standard methods, actions are often assumed to be a rigid,
fixed set of choices that are sequentially applied to the state space in a
predefined manner. Consequently, without resorting to substantial re-learning
processes, the learned policy lacks the ability in adapting to variations in
the action set and the action's "behavioral" outcomes. In addition, the
standard action representation and the action-induced state transition
mechanism inherently limit how reinforcement learning can be applied in
complex, real-world applications primarily due to the intractability of the
resulting large state space and the lack of facility to generalize the learned
policy to the unknown part of the state space. This paper proposes a
Bayesian-flavored generalized reinforcement learning framework by first
establishing the notion of parametric action model to better cope with
uncertainty and fluid action behaviors, followed by introducing the notion of
reinforcement field as a physics-inspired construct established through
"polarized experience particles" maintained in the learning agent's working
memory. These particles effectively encode the dynamic learning experience that
evolves over time in a self-organizing way. On top of the reinforcement field,
we will further generalize the policy learning process to incorporate
high-level decision concepts by considering the past memory as having an
implicit graph structure, in which the past memory instances (or particles) are
interconnected with similarity between decisions defined, and thereby, the
"associative memory" principle can be applied to augment the learning agent's
world model.</p>

    <p>Large-scale undirected weighted networks are usually found in big
data-related research fields. It can naturally be quantified as a symmetric
high-dimensional and incomplete (SHDI) matrix for implementing big data
analysis tasks. A symmetric non-negative latent-factor-analysis (SNL) model is
able to efficiently extract latent factors (LFs) from an SHDI matrix. Yet it
relies on a constraint-combination training scheme, which makes it lack
flexibility. To address this issue, this paper proposes an unconstrained
symmetric nonnegative latent-factor-analysis (USNL) model. Its main idea is
two-fold: 1) The output LFs are separated from the decision parameters via
integrating a nonnegative mapping function into an SNL model; and 2) Stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) is adopted for implementing unconstrained model training
along with ensuring the output LFs nonnegativity. Empirical studies on four
SHDI matrices generated from real big data applications demonstrate that an
USNL model achieves higher prediction accuracy of missing data than an SNL
model, as well as highly competitive computational efficiency.</p>

    <p>Traffic simulation has gained a lot of interest for quantitative evaluation
of self driving vehicles performance. In order for a simulator to be a valuable
test bench, it is required that the driving policy animating each traffic agent
in the scene acts as humans would do while maintaining minimal safety
guarantees. Learning the driving policies of traffic agents from recorded human
driving data or through reinforcement learning seems to be an attractive
solution for the generation of realistic and highly interactive traffic
situations in uncontrolled intersections or roundabouts. In this work, we show
that a trade-off exists between imitating human driving and maintaining safety
when learning driving policies. We do this by comparing how various Imitation
learning and Reinforcement learning algorithms perform when applied to the
driving task. We also propose a multi objective learning algorithm (MOPPO) that
improves both objectives together. We test our driving policies on highly
interactive driving scenarios extracted from INTERACTION Dataset to evaluate
how human-like they behave.</p>

    <p>Recent years have seen a great increase in the capacity and parallel
processing power of data centers and cloud services. To fully utilize the said
distributed systems, optimal load balancing for parallel queuing architectures
must be realized. Existing state-of-the-art solutions fail to consider the
effect of communication delays on the behaviour of very large systems with many
clients. In this work, we consider a multi-agent load balancing system, with
delayed information, consisting of many clients (load balancers) and many
parallel queues. In order to obtain a tractable solution, we model this system
as a mean-field control problem with enlarged state-action space in discrete
time through exact discretization. Subsequently, we apply policy gradient
reinforcement learning algorithms to find an optimal load balancing solution.
Here, the discrete-time system model incorporates a synchronization delay under
which the queue state information is synchronously broadcasted and updated at
all clients. We then provide theoretical performance guarantees for our
methodology in large systems. Finally, using experiments, we prove that our
approach is not only scalable but also shows good performance when compared to
the state-of-the-art power-of-d variant of the Join-the-Shortest-Queue (JSQ)
and other policies in the presence of synchronization delays.</p>

    <p>Exploiting gradient leakage to reconstruct supposedly private training data,
gradient inversion attacks are an ubiquitous threat in collaborative learning
of neural networks. To prevent gradient leakage without suffering from severe
loss in model performance, recent work proposed a PRivacy EnhanCing mODulE
(PRECODE) based on variational modeling as extension for arbitrary model
architectures. In this work, we investigate the effect of PRECODE on gradient
inversion attacks to reveal its underlying working principle. We show that
variational modeling induces stochasticity on PRECODE's and its subsequent
layers' gradients that prevents gradient attacks from convergence. By
purposefully omitting those stochastic gradients during attack optimization, we
formulate an attack that can disable PRECODE's privacy preserving effects. To
ensure privacy preservation against such targeted attacks, we propose PRECODE
with Partial Perturbation (PPP), as strategic combination of variational
modeling and partial gradient perturbation. We conduct an extensive empirical
study on four seminal model architectures and two image classification
datasets. We find all architectures to be prone to gradient leakage, which can
be prevented by PPP. In result, we show that our approach requires less
gradient perturbation to effectively preserve privacy without harming model
performance.</p>

    <p>Fatal diseases, as Critical Health Episodes (CHEs), represent real dangers
for patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units. These episodes can lead to
irreversible organ damage and death. Nevertheless, diagnosing them in time
would greatly reduce their inconvenience. This study therefore focused on
building a highly effective early warning system for CHEs such as Acute
Hypotensive Episodes and Tachycardia Episodes. To facilitate the precocity of
the prediction, a gap of one hour was considered between the observation
periods (Observation Windows) and the periods during which a critical event can
occur (Target Windows). The MIMIC II dataset was used to evaluate the
performance of the proposed system. This system first includes extracting
additional features using three different modes. Then, the feature selection
process allowing the selection of the most relevant features was performed
using the Mutual Information Gain feature importance. Finally, the
high-performance predictive model LightGBM was used to perform episode
classification. This approach called MIG-LightGBM was evaluated using five
different metrics: Event Recall (ER), Reduced Precision (RP), average
Anticipation Time (aveAT), average False Alarms (aveFA), and Event F1-score
(EF1-score). A method is therefore considered highly efficient for the early
prediction of CHEs if it exhibits not only a large aveAT but also a large
EF1-score and a low aveFA. Compared to systems using Extreme Gradient Boosting,
Support Vector Classification or Naive Bayes as a predictive model, the
proposed system was found to be highly dominant. It also confirmed its
superiority over the Layered Learning approach.</p>

    <p>Responsive teaching is a highly effective strategy that promotes student
learning. In math classrooms, teachers might "funnel" students towards a
normative answer or "focus" students to reflect on their own thinking,
deepening their understanding of math concepts. When teachers focus, they treat
students' contributions as resources for collective sensemaking, and thereby
significantly improve students' achievement and confidence in mathematics. We
propose the task of computationally detecting funneling and focusing questions
in classroom discourse. We do so by creating and releasing an annotated dataset
of 2,348 teacher utterances labeled for funneling and focusing questions, or
neither. We introduce supervised and unsupervised approaches to differentiating
these questions. Our best model, a supervised RoBERTa model fine-tuned on our
dataset, has a strong linear correlation of .76 with human expert labels and
with positive educational outcomes, including math instruction quality and
student achievement, showing the model's potential for use in automated teacher
feedback tools. Our unsupervised measures show significant but weaker
correlations with human labels and outcomes, and they highlight interesting
linguistic patterns of funneling and focusing questions. The high performance
of the supervised measure indicates its promise for supporting teachers in
their instruction.</p>

    <p>Adaptive learning aims to stimulate and meet the needs of individual
learners, which requires sophisticated system-level coordination of diverse
tasks, including modeling learning resources, estimating student states, and
making personalized recommendations. Existing deep learning methods have
achieved great success over statistical models; however, they still lack
generalization for diverse tasks and suffer from insufficient capacity since
they are composed of highly-coupled task-specific architectures and rely on
small-scale, coarse-grained recommendation scenarios. To realize the idea of
general adaptive systems proposed in pedagogical theory, with the emerging
pre-training techniques in NLP, we try to conduct a practical exploration on
applying pre-training to adaptive learning, to propose a unified framework
based on data observation and learning style analysis, properly leveraging
heterogeneous learning elements. Through a series of downstream tasks of
Learning Recommendation, Learning Resource Evaluation, Knowledge Tracing, and
Dropout Prediction, we find that course structures, text, and knowledge are
helpful for modeling and inherently coherent to student non-sequential learning
behaviors and that indirectly relevant information included in the pre-training
foundation can be shared across downstream tasks to facilitate effectiveness.
We finally build a simplified systematic application of adaptive learning and
reflect on the insights brought back to pedagogy. The source code and dataset
will be released.</p>

providing an automated classification of physiological data for health
applications in controlled laboratory environments. Ambulatory uncontrolled

utilising machine learning classifiers to detect stress using physiological
data recorded in an ambulatory setting with self-reported stress annotations. A

of the decade. Millions of people are being infected, resulting in thousands of
deaths every day across the globe. Even it was difficult for the best
healthcare-providing countries could not handle the pandemic because of the
strain of treating thousands of patients at a time. The count of infections and
deaths is increasing at an alarming rate because of the spread of the virus. We
believe that innovative technologies could help reduce pandemics to a certain
extent until we find a definite solution from the medical field to handle and
treat such pandemic situations. Technology innovation has the potential to
introduce new technologies that could support people and society during these
difficult times. Therefore, this paper proposes the idea of using drones as a
companion to tackle current and future pandemics. Our COROID drone is based on
the principle of crowdsourcing sensors data of the public's smart devices,
which can correlate the reading of the infrared cameras equipped on the COROID
drones. To the best of our knowledge, this concept has yet to be investigated
either as a concept or as a product. Therefore, we believe that the COROID

    <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health threat, estimated
to cause over 10 million deaths per year and cost the global economy 100
trillion USD by 2050 under status quo projections. These losses would mainly
result from an increase in the morbidity and mortality from treatment failure,
AMR infections during medical procedures, and a loss of quality of life
attributed to AMR. Numerous interventions have been proposed to control the
development of AMR and mitigate the risks posed by its spread. This paper
reviews key aspects of bacterial AMR management and control which make
essential use of data technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and mathematical and statistical modelling, fields that have seen
rapid developments in this century. Although data technologies have become an
integral part of biomedical research, their impact on AMR management has
remained modest. We outline the use of data technologies to combat AMR,
detailing recent advancements in four complementary categories: surveillance,
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We provide an overview on current AMR
control approaches using data technologies within biomedical research, clinical
practice, and in the "One Health" context. We discuss the potential impact and
challenges wider implementation of data technologies is facing in high-income
as well as in low- and middle-income countries, and recommend concrete actions

    <p>A vast amount of data is created every minute, both in the private sector and
industry. Whereas it is often easy to get hold of data in the private
entertainment sector, in the industrial production environment it is much more
difficult due to laws, preservation of intellectual property, and other
factors. However, most machine learning methods require a data source that is
sufficient in terms of quantity and quality. A suitable way to bring both
requirements together is federated learning where learning progress is
aggregated, but everyone remains the owner of their data. Federate learning was
first proposed by Google researchers in 2016 and is used for example in the
improvement of Google's keyboard Gboard. In contrast to billions of android
users, comparable machinery is only used by few companies. This paper examines
which other constraints prevail in production and which federated learning

    <p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) seeks to produce explanations for
those machine learning methods which are deemed opaque. However, there is
considerable disagreement about what this means and how to achieve it. Authors
disagree on what should be explained (topic), to whom something should be

why something should be explained (goal). In this paper, I employ insights from
means-end epistemology to structure the field. According to means-end
epistemology, different means ought to be rationally adopted to achieve
different epistemic ends. Applied to XAI, different topics, stakeholders, and
goals thus require different instruments. I call this the means-end account of
XAI. The means-end account has a descriptive and a normative component: on the
one hand, I show how the specific means-end relations give rise to a taxonomy
of existing contributions to the field of XAI; on the other hand, I argue that
the suitability of XAI methods can be assessed by analyzing whether they are
prescribed by a given topic, stakeholder, and goal.</p>

    <p>Causal identification is at the core of the causal inference literature,
where complete algorithms have been proposed to identify causal queries of
interest. The validity of these algorithms hinges on the restrictive assumption
of having access to a correctly specified causal structure. In this work, we
study the setting where a probabilistic model of the causal structure is
available. Specifically, the edges in a causal graph are assigned probabilities
which may, for example, represent degree of belief from domain experts.
Alternatively, the uncertainly about an edge may reflect the confidence of a
particular statistical test. The question that naturally arises in this setting
is: Given such a probabilistic graph and a specific causal effect of interest,
what is the subgraph which has the highest plausibility and for which the
causal effect is identifiable? We show that answering this question reduces to
solving an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem which we call the edge ID
problem. We propose efficient algorithms to approximate this problem, and
evaluate our proposed algorithms against real-world networks and randomly
generated graphs.</p>

    <p>Despite echo chambers in social media have been under considerable scrutiny,
general models for their detection and analysis are missing. In this work, we
aim to fill this gap by proposing a probabilistic generative model that
explains social media footprints -- i.e., social network structure and
propagations of information -- through a set of latent communities,
characterized by a degree of echo-chamber behavior and by an opinion polarity.
Specifically, echo chambers are modeled as communities that are permeable to
pieces of information with similar ideological polarity, and impermeable to
information of opposed leaning: this allows discriminating echo chambers from
communities that lack a clear ideological alignment.
To learn the model parameters we propose a scalable, stochastic adaptation of
the Generalized Expectation Maximization algorithm, that optimizes the joint
likelihood of observing social connections and information propagation.
Experiments on synthetic data show that our algorithm is able to correctly
reconstruct ground-truth latent communities with their degree of echo-chamber
behavior and opinion polarity. Experiments on real-world data about polarized
social and political debates, such as the Brexit referendum or the COVID-19
vaccine campaign, confirm the effectiveness of our proposal in detecting echo
chambers. Finally, we show how our model can improve accuracy in auxiliary
predictive tasks, such as stance detection and prediction of future
propagations.</p>

    <p>In this work, we propose Reciprocal Distribution Alignment (RDA) to address
semi-supervised learning (SSL), which is a hyperparameter-free framework that
is independent of confidence threshold and works with both the matched
(conventionally) and the mismatched class distributions. Distribution mismatch
is an often overlooked but more general SSL scenario where the labeled and the
unlabeled data do not fall into the identical class distribution. This may lead
to the model not exploiting the labeled data reliably and drastically degrade
the performance of SSL methods, which could not be rescued by the traditional
distribution alignment. In RDA, we enforce a reciprocal alignment on the
distributions of the predictions from two classifiers predicting pseudo-labels
and complementary labels on the unlabeled data. These two distributions,
carrying complementary information, could be utilized to regularize each other
without any prior of class distribution. Moreover, we theoretically show that
RDA maximizes the input-output mutual information. Our approach achieves
promising performance in SSL under a variety of scenarios of mismatched
distributions, as well as the conventional matched SSL setting. Our code is

    <p>Monitoring seed maturity is an increasing challenge in agriculture due to
climate change and more restrictive practices. Seeds monitoring in the field is
essential to optimize the farming process and to guarantee yield quality
through high germination. Traditional methods are based on limited sampling in
the field and analysis in laboratory. Moreover, they are time consuming and
only allow monitoring sub-sections of the crop field. This leads to a lack of
accuracy on the condition of the crop as a whole due to intra-field
heterogeneities. Multispectral imagery by UAV allows uniform scan of fields and
better capture of crop maturity information. On the other hand, deep learning
methods have shown tremendous potential in estimating agronomic parameters,
especially maturity. However, they require large labeled datasets. Although
large sets of aerial images are available, labeling them with ground truth is a
tedious, if not impossible task. In this paper, we propose a method for
estimating parsley seed maturity using multispectral UAV imagery, with a new
approach for automatic data labeling. This approach is based on parametric and
non-parametric models to provide weak labels. We also consider the data
acquisition protocol and the performance evaluation of the different steps of
the method. Results show good performance, and the non-parametric kernel
density estimator model can improve neural network generalization when used as
a labeling method, leading to more robust and better performing deep neural
models.</p>

    <p>Node classification utilizing text-based node attributes has many real-world
applications, ranging from prediction of paper topics in academic citation
graphs to classification of user characteristics in social media networks.
State-of-the-art node classification frameworks, such as GIANT, use a two-stage
pipeline: first embedding the text attributes of graph nodes then feeding the
resulting embeddings into a node classification model. In this paper, we
eliminate these two stages and instead develop an end-to-end node
classification model that builds upon GIANT, called End-to-End-GIANT (E2EG).
The tandem utilization of a main and an auxiliary classification objectives in
our approach results in a more robust model, thus enabling the BERT backbone to
be switched out for a distilled encoder with a 25% - 40% reduction in the
number of parameters. Moreover, the end-to-end nature of the model increases
ease of use, as it avoids the need of chaining multiple models for node
classification. Compared to a GIANT+MLP baseline on the ogbn-arxiv and
ogbn-products datasets, our model is able to obtain slightly better accuracy in
the transductive setting (+0.5%), while reducing model training time by up to
40%. Our model is also applicable in the inductive setting, outperforming
GIANT+MLP by up to +2.23%.</p>

    <p>Recent sequential recommendation models rely increasingly on consecutive
short-term user-item interaction sequences to model user interests. These
approaches have, however, raised concerns about both short- and long-term
interests. (1) {\it short-term}: interaction sequences may not result from a
monolithic interest, but rather from several intertwined interests, even within
a short period of time, resulting in their failures to model skip behaviors;
(2) {\it long-term}: interaction sequences are primarily observed sparsely at
discrete intervals, other than consecutively over the long run. This renders
difficulty in inferring long-term interests, since only discrete interest
representations can be derived, without taking into account interest dynamics
across sequences. In this study, we address these concerns by learning (1)
multi-scale representations of short-term interests; and (2) dynamics-aware
representations of long-term interests. To this end, we present an
\textbf{I}nterest \textbf{D}ynamics modeling framework using generative
\textbf{N}eural \textbf{P}rocesses, coined IDNP, to model user interests from a
functional perspective. IDNP learns a global interest function family to define
each user's long-term interest as a function instantiation, manifesting
interest dynamics through function continuity. Specifically, IDNP first encodes
each user's short-term interactions into multi-scale representations, which are
then summarized as user context. By combining latent global interest with user
context, IDNP then reconstructs long-term user interest functions and predicts
interactions at upcoming query timestep. Moreover, IDNP can model such interest
functions even when interaction sequences are limited and non-consecutive.
Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our model
outperforms state-of-the-arts on various evaluation metrics.</p>

    <p>Progress in automated microscopy and quantitative image analysis has promoted
high-content screening (HCS) as an efficient drug discovery and research tool.
While HCS offers to quantify complex cellular phenotypes from images at high
throughput, this process can be obstructed by image aberrations such as
out-of-focus image blur, fluorophore saturation, debris, a high level of noise,
unexpected auto-fluorescence or empty images. While this issue has received
moderate attention in the literature, overlooking these artefacts can seriously
hamper downstream image processing tasks and hinder detection of subtle
phenotypes. It is therefore of primary concern, and a prerequisite, to use
quality control in HCS. In this work, we evaluate deep learning options that do
not require extensive image annotations to provide a straightforward and easy
to use semi-supervised learning solution to this issue. Concretely, we compared
the efficacy of recent self-supervised and transfer learning approaches to
provide a base encoder to a high throughput artefact image detector. The
results of this study suggest that transfer learning methods should be
preferred for this task as they not only performed best here but present the
advantage of not requiring sensitive hyperparameter settings nor extensive
additional training.</p>

    <p>The shuffle model of differential privacy has gained significant interest as

locally randomized data amplifies differential privacy guarantees. Such
amplification implies substantially stronger privacy guarantees for systems in
which data is contributed anonymously [BEMMRLRKTS17].
In this work, we improve the state of the art privacy amplification by
shuffling results both theoretically and numerically. Our first contribution is
the first asymptotically optimal analysis of the Rényi differential privacy
parameters for the shuffled outputs of LDP randomizers. Our second contribution
is a new analysis of privacy amplification by shuffling. This analysis improves

    <p>Estimating long-term causal effects based on short-term surrogates is a
significant but challenging problem in many real-world applications, e.g.,
marketing and medicine. Despite its success in certain domains, most existing
methods estimate causal effects in an idealistic and simplistic way - ignoring
the causal structure among short-term outcomes and treating all of them as
surrogates. However, such methods cannot be well applied to real-world
scenarios, in which the partially observed surrogates are mixed with their
proxies among short-term outcomes. To this end, we develop our flexible method,
Laser, to estimate long-term causal effects in the more realistic situation
that the surrogates are observed or have observed proxies.Given the
indistinguishability between the surrogates and proxies, we utilize
identifiable variational auto-encoder (iVAE) to recover the whole valid
surrogates on all the surrogates candidates without the need of distinguishing
the observed surrogates or the proxies of latent surrogates. With the help of
the recovered surrogates, we further devise an unbiased estimation of long-term
causal effects. Extensive experimental results on the real-world and
semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

    <p>Graph similarity measurement, which computes the distance/similarity between
two graphs, arises in various graph-related tasks. Recent learning-based
methods lack interpretability, as they directly transform interaction
information between two graphs into one hidden vector and then map it to
similarity. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a more interpretable
end-to-end paradigm for graph similarity learning, named Similarity Computation
via Maximum Common Subgraph Inference (INFMCS). Our critical insight into
INFMCS is the strong correlation between similarity score and Maximum Common
Subgraph (MCS). We implicitly infer MCS to obtain the normalized MCS size, with
the supervision information being only the similarity score during training. To
capture more global information, we also stack some vanilla transformer encoder
layers with graph convolution layers and propose a novel permutation-invariant
node Positional Encoding. The entire model is quite simple yet effective.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that INFMCS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines for graph-graph classification and regression tasks.
Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed computation
paradigm and other components. Also, visualization and statistics of results
reveal the interpretability of INFMCS.</p>

    <p>Simulation has played an important role in efficiently evaluating
self-driving vehicles in terms of scalability. Existing methods mostly rely on
heuristic-based simulation, where traffic participants follow certain
human-encoded rules that fail to generate complex human behaviors. Therefore,
the reactive simulation concept is proposed to bridge the human behavior gap
between simulation and real-world traffic scenarios by leveraging real-world
data. However, these reactive models can easily generate unreasonable behaviors
after a few steps of simulation, where we regard the model as losing its
stability. To the best of our knowledge, no work has explicitly discussed and
analyzed the stability of the reactive simulation framework. In this paper, we
aim to provide a thorough stability analysis of the reactive simulation and
propose a solution to enhance the stability. Specifically, we first propose a
new reactive simulation framework, where we discover that the smoothness and
consistency of the simulated state sequences are crucial factors to stability.
We then incorporate the kinematic vehicle model into the framework to improve
the closed-loop stability of the reactive simulation. Furthermore, along with
commonly-used metrics, several novel metrics are proposed in this paper to
better analyze the simulation performance.</p>

novel objective function, each layer in HR-VQVAE learns a discrete
representation of the residual from previous layers through a vector quantized

linked to those at previous layers. We evaluate our method on the tasks of
image reconstruction and generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the
discrete representations learned by HR-VQVAE enable the decoder to reconstruct
high-quality images with less distortion than the baseline methods, namely
VQVAE and VQVAE-2. HR-VQVAE can also generate high-quality and diverse images
that outperform state-of-the-art generative models, providing further
verification of the efficiency of the learned representations. The hierarchical
nature of HR-VQVAE i) reduces the decoding search time, making the method

    <p>DBSCAN is widely used in many scientific and engineering fields because of
its simplicity and practicality. However, due to its high sensitivity
parameters, the accuracy of the clustering result depends heavily on practical
experience. In this paper, we first propose a novel Deep Reinforcement Learning
guided automatic DBSCAN parameters search framework, namely DRL-DBSCAN. The
framework models the process of adjusting the parameter search direction by
perceiving the clustering environment as a Markov decision process, which aims
to find the best clustering parameters without manual assistance. DRL-DBSCAN
learns the optimal clustering parameter search policy for different feature
distributions via interacting with the clusters, using a weakly-supervised
reward training policy network. In addition, we also present a recursive search
mechanism driven by the scale of the data to efficiently and controllably
process large parameter spaces. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
artificial and real-world datasets based on the proposed four working modes.
The results of offline and online tasks show that the DRL-DBSCAN not only
consistently improves DBSCAN clustering accuracy by up to 26% and 25%
respectively, but also can stably find the dominant parameters with high
computational efficiency. The code is available at

    <p>This work considers the task of representation learning on the attributed
relational graph (ARG). Both the nodes and edges in an ARG are associated with
attributes/features allowing ARGs to encode rich structural information widely
observed in real applications. Existing graph neural networks offer limited
ability to capture complex interactions within local structural contexts, which
hinders them from taking advantage of the expression power of ARGs. We propose
Motif Convolution Module (MCM), a new motif-based graph representation learning
technique to better utilize local structural information. The ability to handle
continuous edge and node features is one of MCM's advantages over existing
motif-based models. MCM builds a motif vocabulary in an unsupervised way and
deploys a novel motif convolution operation to extract the local structural
context of individual nodes, which is then used to learn higher-level node
representations via multilayer perceptron and/or message passing in graph
neural networks. When compared with other graph learning approaches to
classifying synthetic graphs, our approach is substantially better in capturing
structural context. We also demonstrate the performance and explainability
advantages of our approach by applying it to several molecular benchmarks.</p>

    <p>The success of deep learning comes at a tremendous computational and energy
cost, and the scalability of training massively overparametrized neural
networks is becoming a real barrier to the progress of AI. Despite the
popularity and low cost-per-iteration of traditional Backpropagation via
gradient decent, SGD has prohibitive convergence rate in non-convex settings,
both in theory and practice.
To mitigate this cost, recent works have proposed to employ alternative
(Newton-type) training methods with much faster convergence rate, albeit with
higher cost-per-iteration. For a typical neural network with
$m=\mathrm{poly}(n)$ parameters and input batch of $n$ datapoints in
$\mathbb{R}^d$, the previous work of [Brand, Peng, Song, and Weinstein,
ITCS'2021] requires $\sim mnd + n^3$ time per iteration. In this paper, we
present a novel training method that requires only $m^{1-\alpha} n d + n^3$
amortized time in the same overparametrized regime, where $\alpha \in (0.01,1)$
is some fixed constant. This method relies on a new and alternative view of
neural networks, as a set of binary search trees, where each iteration
corresponds to modifying a small subset of the nodes in the tree. We believe
this view would have further applications in the design and analysis of DNNs.</p>

    <p>Federated learning (FL) is a newly emerged branch of AI that facilitates edge
devices to collaboratively train a global machine learning model without
centralizing data and with privacy by default. However, despite the remarkable
advancement, this paradigm comes with various challenges. Specifically, in
large-scale deployments, client heterogeneity is the norm which impacts
training quality such as accuracy, fairness, and time. Moreover, energy
consumption across these battery-constrained devices is largely unexplored and
a limitation for wide-adoption of FL. To address this issue, we develop EAFL,
an energy-aware FL selection method that considers energy consumption to
maximize the participation of heterogeneous target devices. \scheme is a
power-aware training algorithm that cherry-picks clients with higher battery
levels in conjunction with its ability to maximize the system efficiency. Our
design jointly minimizes the time-to-accuracy and maximizes the remaining
on-device battery levels. \scheme improves the testing model accuracy by up to
85\% and decreases the drop-out of clients by up to 2.45$\times$.</p>

    <p>In this paper, we present an energy-efficient SNN architecture, which can
seamlessly run deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) with improved accuracy.
First, we propose a conversion aware training (CAT) to reduce ANN-to-SNN
conversion loss without hardware implementation overhead. In the proposed CAT,
the activation function developed for simulating SNN during ANN training, is
efficiently exploited to reduce the data representation error after conversion.
Based on the CAT technique, we also present a time-to-first-spike coding that
allows lightweight logarithmic computation by utilizing spike time information.
The SNN processor design that supports the proposed techniques has been
implemented using 28nm CMOS process. The processor achieves the top-1
accuracies of 91.7%, 67.9% and 57.4% with inference energy of 486.7uJ, 503.6uJ,
and 1426uJ to process CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet, respectively,
when running VGG-16 with 5bit logarithmic weights.</p>

    <p>This work uses the entropy-regularised relaxed stochastic control perspective
as a principled framework for designing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
Herein agent interacts with the environment by generating noisy controls
distributed according to the optimal relaxed policy. The noisy policies on the
one hand, explore the space and hence facilitate learning but, on the other
hand, introduce bias by assigning a positive probability to non-optimal
actions. This exploration-exploitation trade-off is determined by the strength
of entropy regularisation. We study algorithms resulting from two entropy
regularisation formulations: the exploratory control approach, where entropy is
added to the cost objective, and the proximal policy update approach, where
entropy penalises the divergence of policies between two consecutive episodes.
We analyse the finite horizon continuous-time linear-quadratic (LQ) RL problem
for which both algorithms yield a Gaussian relaxed policy. We quantify the
precise difference between the value functions of a Gaussian policy and its
noisy evaluation and show that the execution noise must be independent across
time. By tuning the frequency of sampling from relaxed policies and the
parameter governing the strength of entropy regularisation, we prove that the
regret, for both learning algorithms, is of the order $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N}) $
(up to a logarithmic factor)
over $N$ episodes, matching the best known result from the literature.</p>

    <p>Deep and wide neural networks successfully fit very complex functions today,
but dense models are starting to be prohibitively expensive for inference. To
mitigate this, one promising direction is networks that activate a sparse
subgraph of the network. The subgraph is chosen by a data-dependent routing
function, enforcing a fixed mapping of inputs to subnetworks (e.g., the Mixture
of Experts (MoE) paradigm in Switch Transformers). However, prior work is
largely empirical, and while existing routing functions work well in practice,
they do not lead to theoretical guarantees on approximation ability. We aim to
provide a theoretical explanation for the power of sparse networks. As our
first contribution, we present a formal model of data-dependent sparse networks
that captures salient aspects of popular architectures. We then introduce a
routing function based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that enables us to
reason about how well sparse networks approximate target functions. After
representing LSH-based sparse networks with our model, we prove that sparse
networks can match the approximation power of dense networks on Lipschitz
functions. Applying LSH on the input vectors means that the experts interpolate
the target function in different subregions of the input space. To support our
theory, we define various datasets based on Lipschitz target functions, and we
show that sparse networks give a favorable trade-off between number of active
units and approximation quality.</p>

    <p>We introduce NeuralVDB, which improves on an existing industry standard for
efficient storage of sparse volumetric data, denoted VDB, by leveraging recent
advancements in machine learning. Our novel hybrid data structure can reduce
the memory footprints of VDB volumes by orders of magnitude, while maintaining
its flexibility and only incurring a small (user-controlled) compression
errors. Specifically, NeuralVDB replaces the lower nodes of a shallow and wide
VDB tree structure with multiple hierarchy neural networks that separately
encode topology and value information by means of neural classifiers and
regressors respectively. This approach has proven to maximize the compression
ratio while maintaining the spatial adaptivity offered by the higher-level VDB
data structure. For sparse signed distance fields and density volumes, we have
observed compression ratios on the order of $10\times$ to more than $100\times$
from already compressed VDB inputs, with little to no visual artifacts. We also
demonstrate how its application to animated sparse volumes can both accelerate
training and generate temporally coherent neural networks.</p>

    <p>This paper concerns pseudo labelling in segmentation. Our contribution is
fourfold. Firstly, we present a new formulation of pseudo-labelling as an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clear statistical interpretation.
Secondly, we propose a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method purely
based on the original pseudo labelling, namely SegPL. We demonstrate SegPL is a
competitive approach against state-of-the-art consistency regularisation based
methods on semi-supervised segmentation on a 2D multi-class MRI brain tumour
segmentation task and a 3D binary CT lung vessel segmentation task. The
simplicity of SegPL allows less computational cost comparing to prior methods.
Thirdly, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of SegPL may originate from its
robustness against out-of-distribution noises and adversarial attacks. Lastly,
under the EM framework, we introduce a probabilistic generalisation of SegPL
via variational inference, which learns a dynamic threshold for pseudo
labelling during the training. We show that SegPL with variational inference
can perform uncertainty estimation on par with the gold-standard method Deep
Ensemble.</p>

    <p>The performance of trained neural networks is robust to harsh levels of
pruning. Coupled with the ever-growing size of deep learning models, this
observation has motivated extensive research on learning sparse models. In this
work, we focus on the task of controlling the level of sparsity when performing
sparse learning. Existing methods based on sparsity-inducing penalties involve
expensive trial-and-error tuning of the penalty factor, thus lacking direct
control of the resulting model sparsity. In response, we adopt a constrained
formulation: using the gate mechanism proposed by Louizos et al. (2018), we
formulate a constrained optimization problem where sparsification is guided by
the training objective and the desired sparsity target in an end-to-end
fashion. Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet using
WideResNet and ResNet{18, 50} models validate the effectiveness of our proposal
and demonstrate that we can reliably achieve pre-determined sparsity targets
without compromising on predictive performance.</p>

    <p>We study the problem of graph structure identification, i.e., of recovering
the graph of dependencies among time series. We model these time series data as
components of the state of linear stochastic networked dynamical systems. We
assume partial observability, where the state evolution of only a subset of
nodes comprising the network is observed. We devise a new feature vector
computed from the observed time series and prove that these features are
linearly separable, i.e., there exists a hyperplane that separates the cluster
of features associated with connected pairs of nodes from those associated with
disconnected pairs. This renders the features amenable to train a variety of
classifiers to perform causal inference. In particular, we use these features
to train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The resulting causal inference
mechanism outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts w.r.t. sample-complexity.
The trained CNNs generalize well over structurally distinct networks (dense or
sparse) and noise-level profiles. Remarkably, they also generalize well to
real-world networks while trained over a synthetic network (realization of a
random graph). Finally, the proposed method consistently reconstructs the graph
in a pairwise manner, that is, by deciding if an edge or arrow is present or
absent in each pair of nodes, from the corresponding time series of each pair.
This fits the framework of large-scale systems, where observation or processing
of all nodes in the network is prohibitive.</p>

    <p>Passive beamforming in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) enables a
feasible and efficient way of communication when the RIS reflection
coefficients are precisely adjusted. In this paper, we present a framework to
track the RIS reflection coefficients with the aid of deep learning from a
time-series prediction perspective in a terahertz (THz) communication system.
The proposed framework achieves a two-step enhancement over the similar
learning-driven counterparts. Specifically, in the first step, we train a
liquid state machine (LSM) to track the historical RIS reflection coefficients
at prior time steps (known as a time-series sequence) and predict their
upcoming time steps. We also fine-tune the trained LSM through Xavier
initialization technique to decrease the prediction variance, thus resulting in
a higher prediction accuracy. In the second step, we use ensemble learning
technique which leverages on the prediction power of multiple LSMs to minimize
the prediction variance and improve the precision of the first step. It is
numerically demonstrated that, in the first step, employing the Xavier
initialization technique to fine-tune the LSM results in at most 26% lower LSM
prediction variance and as much as 46% achievable spectral efficiency (SE)
improvement over the existing counterparts, when an RIS of size 11x11 is
deployed. In the second step, under the same computational complexity of
training a single LSM, the ensemble learning with multiple LSMs degrades the
prediction variance of a single LSM up to 66% and improves the system
achievable SE at most 54%.</p>

    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>
    <p>The automated machine learning (AutoML) process can require searching through
complex configuration spaces of not only machine learning (ML) components and
their hyperparameters but also ways of composing them together, i.e. forming ML
pipelines. Optimisation efficiency and the model accuracy attainable for a
fixed time budget suffer if this pipeline configuration space is excessively
large. A key research question is whether it is both possible and practical to
preemptively avoid costly evaluations of poorly performing ML pipelines by
leveraging their historical performance for various ML tasks, i.e.
meta-knowledge. The previous experience comes in the form of
classifier/regressor accuracy rankings derived from either (1) a substantial
but non-exhaustive number of pipeline evaluations made during historical AutoML
runs, i.e. 'opportunistic' meta-knowledge, or (2) comprehensive cross-validated
evaluations of classifiers/regressors with default hyperparameters, i.e.
'systematic' meta-knowledge. Numerous experiments with the AutoWeka4MCPS
package suggest that (1) opportunistic/systematic meta-knowledge can improve ML
outcomes, typically in line with how relevant that meta-knowledge is, and (2)
configuration-space culling is optimal when it is neither too conservative nor
too radical. However, the utility and impact of meta-knowledge depend
critically on numerous facets of its generation and exploitation, warranting
extensive analysis; these are often overlooked/underappreciated within AutoML
and meta-learning literature. In particular, we observe strong sensitivity to
the `challenge' of a dataset, i.e. whether specificity in choosing a predictor
leads to significantly better performance. Ultimately, identifying `difficult'
datasets, thus defined, is crucial to both generating informative
meta-knowledge bases and understanding optimal search-space reduction
strategies.</p>

    <p>While overfitting and, more generally, double descent are ubiquitous in
machine learning, increasing the number of parameters of the most widely used
tensor network, the matrix product state (MPS), has generally lead to monotonic
improvement of test performance in previous studies. To better understand the
generalization properties of architectures parameterized by MPS, we construct
artificial data which can be exactly modeled by an MPS and train the models
with different number of parameters. We observe model overfitting for
one-dimensional data, but also find that for more complex data overfitting is
less significant, while with MNIST image data we do not find any signatures of
overfitting. We speculate that generalization properties of MPS depend on the
properties of data: with one-dimensional data (for which the MPS ansatz is the
most suitable) MPS is prone to overfitting, while with more complex data which
cannot be fit by MPS exactly, overfitting may be much less significant.</p>

representation learning and weight similarity measure. We extend the
traditional hypothesis-testing method to a hypothesis-training-testing
statistical inference method to validate the hypothesis on the weight
similarity of neural networks. With the chain normalization rule and the new
statistical inference, we study the weight similarity measure on Multi-Layer
Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Recurrent Neural

optimized with the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm converge to a
similar local solution in a metric space. The weight similarity measure
provides more insight into the local solutions of neural networks. Experiments
on several datasets consistently validate the hypothesis of weight similarity

has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power
integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power
forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the
WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always
demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique
Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the
spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors.
Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind
turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines
at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data
of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative

    <p>Catching and attributing code change-induced performance regressions in
production is hard; predicting them beforehand, even harder. A primer on
automatically learning to predict performance regressions in software, this
article gives an account of the experiences we gained when researching and
deploying an ML-based regression prediction pipeline at Meta. In this paper, we
report on a comparative study with four ML models of increasing complexity,
from (1) code-opaque, over (2) Bag of Words, (3) off-the-shelve
Transformer-based, to (4) a bespoke Transformer-based model, coined
SuperPerforator. Our investigation shows the inherent difficulty of the
performance prediction problem, which is characterized by a large imbalance of
benign onto regressing changes. Our results also call into question the general
applicability of Transformer-based architectures for performance prediction: an
off-the-shelve CodeBERT-based approach had surprisingly poor performance; our
highly customized SuperPerforator architecture initially achieved prediction
performance that was just on par with simpler Bag of Words models, and only
outperformed them for down-stream use cases. This ability of SuperPerforator to
transfer to an application with few learning examples afforded an opportunity
to deploy it in practice at Meta: it can act as a pre-filter to sort out
changes that are unlikely to introduce a regression, truncating the space of
changes to search a regression in by up to 43%, a 45x improvement over a random
baseline. To gain further insight into SuperPerforator, we explored it via a
series of experiments computing counterfactual explanations. These highlight
which parts of a code change the model deems important, thereby validating the
learned black-box model.</p>

Researchers and developers in the traffic domain have also designed and
improved DL models for forecasting tasks such as estimation of traffic speed

models due to the black-box property of DL models and complexity of traffic

we design a visual analytics system, AttnAnalyzer, that enables users to

    <p>This paper presents an open-source Python toolbox called Ensemble Feature
Importance (EFI) to provide machine learning (ML) researchers, domain experts,
and decision makers with robust and accurate feature importance quantification
and more reliable mechanistic interpretation of feature importance for
prediction problems using fuzzy sets. The toolkit was developed to address
uncertainties in feature importance quantification and lack of trustworthy
feature importance interpretation due to the diverse availability of machine
learning algorithms, feature importance calculation methods, and dataset
dependencies. EFI merges results from multiple machine learning models with
different feature importance calculation approaches using data bootstrapping
and decision fusion techniques, such as mean, majority voting and fuzzy logic.
The main attributes of the EFI toolbox are: (i) automatic optimisation of ML
algorithms, (ii) automatic computation of a set of feature importance

    <p>Partial least square regression (PLSR) is a widely-used statistical model to
reveal the linear relationships of latent factors that comes from the
independent variables and dependent variables. However, traditional methods
\ql{ to solve PLSR models are usually based on the Euclidean space, and easily
getting} stuck into a local minimum. To this end, we propose a new method to
solve the partial least square regression, named PLSR via optimization on
bi-Grassmann manifold (PLSRbiGr). \ql{Specifically, we first leverage} the
three-factor SVD-type decomposition of the cross-covariance matrix defined on
the bi-Grassmann manifold, converting the orthogonal constrained optimization
problem into an unconstrained optimization problem on bi-Grassmann manifold,
and then incorporate the Riemannian preconditioning of matrix scaling to
regulate the Riemannian metric in each iteration. \ql{PLSRbiGr is validated}
with a variety of experiments for decoding EEG signals at motor imagery (MI)
and steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) task. Experimental results
demonstrate that PLSRbiGr outperforms competing algorithms in multiple EEG
decoding tasks, which will greatly facilitate small sample data learning.</p>

    <p>We investigate a data quality-aware dynamic client selection problem for
multiple federated learning (FL) services in a wireless network, where each

    <p>Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) is an important research means
in the fields of physics, biology, and chemistry. As an approximate alternative
to numerical methods, PINN has received extensive attention and played an
important role in many fields. However, PINN uses a fully connected network as
its model, which has limited fitting ability and limited extrapolation ability
in both time and space. In this paper, we propose PhyGNNet for solving partial
differential equations on the basics of a graph neural network which consists
of encoder, processer, and decoder blocks. In particular, we divide the
computing area into regular grids, define partial differential operators on the
grids, then construct pde loss for the network to optimize to build PhyGNNet
model. What's more, we conduct comparative experiments on Burgers equation and
heat equation to validate our approach, the results show that our method has
better fit ability and extrapolation ability both in time and spatial areas
compared with PINN.</p>

    <p>Independent component analysis is an unsupervised learning approach for
computing the independent components (ICs) from the multivariate signals or
data matrix. The ICs are evaluated based on the multiplication of the weight
matrix with the multivariate data matrix. This study proposes a novel memristor
crossbar array for the implementation of both ACY ICA and Fast ICA for blind
source separation. The data input was applied in the form of pulse width
modulated voltages to the crossbar array and the weight of the implemented
neural network is stored in the memristor. The output charges from the
memristor columns are used to calculate the weight update, which is executed
through the voltages kept higher than the memristor Set/Reset voltages. In
order to demonstrate its potential application, the proposed memristor crossbar
arrays based fast ICA architecture is employed for image source separation
problem. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is
very effective to separate image sources, and also the contrast of the images
are improved with an improvement factor in terms of percentage of structural
similarity as 67.27% when compared with the software-based implementation of
conventional ACY ICA and Fast ICA algorithms.</p>

    <p>Dysphonia is one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most
existing methods use feature selection methods to find the optimal subset of
voice features for all PD patients to improve the prediction performance. Few
have considered the heterogeneity between patients, which implies the need to
provide specific prediction models for different patients. However, building
this prediction model for each patient faces the challenge of small sample
size, which makes it lack generalization ability. Instance transfer is an
effective way to make up for this deficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a
patient-specific game-based transfer (PSGT) method for PD severity prediction.
First, a selection mechanism is used to select PD patients with similar disease
trends to the target patient from the source domain, which greatly reduces the
scope of instance transfer and reduces the risk of negative transfer. Then, the
contribution of the transferred subjects and their instances to the disease
estimation of the target subject is fairly evaluated by the Shapley value,
which improves the interpretability of the method. Next, the proportion of
valid instances is determined according to the contribution of transferred
subjects, and the instances with higher contribution are transferred based on
this proportion to further reduce the difference between the transferred
instance subset and the target subject. Finally, the selected subset of
instances is added to the training set of the target subject, and the extended
data is fed into the random forest to improve the performance of the PD
severity prediction method. Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset is used to
evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness. Experiment results show that the
proposed PSGT method has better performance in both prediction error and
stability over compared methods.</p>

    <p>Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences that have been recently
found effective for time series clustering (TSC). The shapelets are convenient
for interpreting the clusters. Thus, the main challenge for TSC is to discover
high-quality variable-length shapelets to discriminate different clusters. In
this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder-shapelet approach (AUTOSHAPE), which
is the first study to take the advantage of both autoencoder and shapelet for
determining shapelets in an unsupervised manner. An autoencoder is specially
designed to learn high-quality shapelets. More specifically, for guiding the
latent representation learning, we employ the latest self-supervised loss to
learn the unified embeddings for variable-length shapelet candidates (time
series subsequences) of different variables, and propose the diversity loss to
select the discriminating embeddings in the unified space. We introduce the
reconstruction loss to recover shapelets in the original time series space for
clustering. Finally, we adopt Davies Bouldin index (DBI) to inform AUTOSHAPE of
the clustering performance during learning. We present extensive experiments on
AUTOSHAPE. To evaluate the clustering performance on univariate time series
(UTS), we compare AUTOSHAPE with 15 representative methods using UCR archive
datasets. To study the performance of multivariate time series (MTS), we
evaluate AUTOSHAPE on 30 UEA archive datasets with 5 competitive methods. The
results validate that AUTOSHAPE is the best among all the methods compared. We
interpret clusters with shapelets, and can obtain interesting intuitions about
clusters in three UTS case studies and one MTS case study, respectively.</p>

    <p>We formulate a class of physics-driven deep latent variable models (PDDLVM)
to learn parameter-to-solution (forward) and solution-to-parameter (inverse)
maps of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs). Our formulation
leverages the finite element method (FEM), deep neural networks, and
probabilistic modeling to assemble a deep probabilistic framework in which the
forward and inverse maps are approximated with coherent uncertainty
quantification. Our probabilistic model explicitly incorporates a parametric
PDE-based density and a trainable solution-to-parameter network while the
introduced amortized variational family postulates a parameter-to-solution
network, all of which are jointly trained. Furthermore, the proposed
methodology does not require any expensive PDE solves and is physics-informed
only at training time, which allows real-time emulation of PDEs and generation
of inverse problem solutions after training, bypassing the need for FEM solve
operations with comparable accuracy to FEM solutions. The proposed framework
further allows for a seamless integration of observed data for solving inverse
problems and building generative models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method on a nonlinear Poisson problem, elastic shells with complex 3D
geometries, and integrating generic physics-informed neural networks (PINN)
architectures. We achieve up to three orders of magnitude speed-ups after
training compared to traditional FEM solvers, while outputting coherent

    <p>Molecular property prediction is of crucial importance in many disciplines
such as drug discovery, molecular biology, or material and process design. The
frequently employed quantitative structure-property/activity relationships
(QSPRs/QSARs) characterize molecules by descriptors which are then mapped to
the properties of interest via a linear or nonlinear model. In contrast, graph
neural networks, a novel machine learning method, directly work on the
molecular graph, i.e., a graph representation where atoms correspond to nodes
and bonds correspond to edges. GNNs allow to learn properties in an end-to-end
fashion, thereby avoiding the need for informative descriptors as in
QSPRs/QSARs. GNNs have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art prediction
performance on various property predictions tasks and represent an active field
of research. We describe the fundamentals of GNNs and demonstrate the
application of GNNs via two examples for molecular property prediction.</p>

    <p>By enabling multiple agents to cooperatively solve a global optimization
problem in the absence of a central coordinator, decentralized stochastic
optimization is gaining increasing attention in areas as diverse as machine
learning, control, and sensor networks. Since the associated data usually
contain sensitive information, such as user locations and personal identities,
privacy protection has emerged as a crucial need in the implementation of
decentralized stochastic optimization. In this paper, we propose a
decentralized stochastic optimization algorithm that is able to guarantee
provable convergence accuracy even in the presence of aggressive quantization
errors that are proportional to the amplitude of quantization inputs. The
result applies to both convex and non-convex objective functions, and enables
us to exploit aggressive quantization schemes to obfuscate shared information,
and hence enables privacy protection without losing provable optimization
accuracy. In fact, by using a {stochastic} ternary quantization scheme, which
quantizes any value to three numerical levels, we achieve quantization-based
rigorous differential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization, which
has not been reported before. In combination with the presented quantization
scheme, the proposed algorithm ensures, for the first time, rigorous
differential privacy in decentralized stochastic optimization without losing
provable convergence accuracy. Simulation results for a distributed estimation
problem as well as numerical experiments for decentralized learning on a
benchmark machine learning dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.</p>

    <p>Optimizing management practices and selecting the best cultivar for planting
play a significant role in increasing agricultural food production and
decreasing environmental footprint. In this study, we develop optimization
frameworks under uncertainty using conditional value-at-risk in the stochastic
programming objective function. We integrate the crop model, APSIM, and a
parallel Bayesian optimization algorithm to optimize the management practices
and select the best cultivar at different levels of risk aversion. This
approach integrates the power of optimization in determining the best decisions
and crop model in simulating nature's output corresponding to various
decisions. As a case study, we set up the crop model for 25 locations across
the US Corn Belt. We optimized the management options (planting date, N
fertilizer amount, fertilizing date, and plant density in the farm) and
cultivar options (cultivars with different maturity days) three times: a)
before, b) at planting and c) after a growing season with known weather.
Results indicated that the proposed model produced meaningful connections
between weather and optima decisions. Also, we found risk-tolerance farmers get
more expected yield than risk-averse ones in wet and non-wet weathers.</p>

    <p>Currently, data-driven discovery in biological sciences resides in finding
segmentation strategies in multivariate data that produce sensible descriptions
of the data. Clustering is but one of several approaches and sometimes falls
short because of difficulties in assessing reasonable cutoffs, the number of
clusters that need to be formed or that an approach fails to preserve
topological properties of the original system in its clustered form. In this
work, we show how a simple metric for connectivity clustering evaluation leads
to an optimised segmentation of biological data.
The novelty of the work resides in the creation of a simple optimisation
method for clustering crowded data. The resulting clustering approach only
relies on metrics derived from the inherent properties of the clustering. The
new method facilitates knowledge for optimised clustering, which is easy to
implement.
We discuss how the clustering optimisation strategy corresponds to the viable
information content yielded by the final segmentation. We further elaborate on
how the clustering results, in the optimal solution, corresponds to prior
knowledge of three different data sets.</p>

    <p>Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) typically grows from the inner ear to the brain.
It can be separated into two regions, intrameatal and extrameatal respectively
corresponding to being inside or outside the inner ear canal. The growth of the
extrameatal regions is a key factor that determines the disease management
followed by the clinicians. In this work, a VS segmentation approach with
subdivision into intra-/extra-meatal parts is presented. We annotated a dataset
consisting of 227 T2 MRI instances, acquired longitudinally on 137 patients,
excluding post-operative instances. We propose a staged approach, with the
first stage performing the whole tumour segmentation and the second stage
performing the intra-/extra-meatal segmentation using the T2 MRI along with the
mask obtained from the first stage. To improve on the accuracy of the predicted
meatal boundary, we introduce a task-specific loss which we call Boundary
Distance Loss. The performance is evaluated in contrast to the direct
intrameatal extrameatal segmentation task performance, i.e. the Baseline. Our
proposed method, with the two-stage approach and the Boundary Distance Loss,
achieved a Dice score of 0.8279+-0.2050 and 0.7744+-0.1352 for extrameatal and
intrameatal regions respectively, significantly improving over the Baseline,
which gave Dice score of 0.7939+-0.2325 and 0.7475+-0.1346 for the extrameatal

    <p>Speaker localization using microphone arrays depends on accurate time delay

purpose. Recently, the GCC-PHAT has also been used to provide input features to
neural networks in order to remove the effects of noise and reverberation, but
at the cost of losing theoretical guarantees in noise-free conditions. We
propose a novel approach to extending the GCC-PHAT, where the received signals
are filtered using a shift equivariant neural network that preserves the timing

    <p>In this paper, we propose and analyze algorithms for zeroth-order
optimization of non-convex composite objectives, focusing on reducing the
complexity dependence on dimensionality. This is achieved by exploiting the low
dimensional structure of the decision set using the stochastic mirror descent
method with an entropy alike function, which performs gradient descent in the
space equipped with the maximum norm. To improve the gradient estimation, we
replace the classic Gaussian smoothing method with a sampling method based on
the Rademacher distribution and show that the mini-batch method copes with the
non-Euclidean geometry. To avoid tuning hyperparameters, we analyze the
adaptive stepsizes for the general stochastic mirror descent and show that the
adaptive version of the proposed algorithm converges without requiring prior
knowledge about the problem.</p>

    <p>This paper analyzes a popular loss function used in machine learning called
the log-cosh loss function. A number of papers have been published using this
loss function but, to date, no statistical analysis has been presented in the
literature. In this paper, we present the distribution function from which the
log-cosh loss arises. We compare it to a similar distribution, called the
Cauchy distribution, and carry out various statistical procedures that
characterize its properties. In particular, we examine its associated pdf, cdf,
likelihood function and Fisher information. Side-by-side we consider the Cauchy
and Cosh distributions as well as the MLE of the location parameter with
asymptotic bias, asymptotic variance, and confidence intervals. We also provide
a comparison of robust estimators from several other loss functions, including
the Huber loss function and the rank dispersion function. Further, we examine
the use of the log-cosh function for quantile regression. In particular, we
identify a quantile distribution function from which a maximum likelihood
estimator for quantile regression can be derived. Finally, we compare a
quantile M-estimator based on log-cosh with robust monotonicity against another
approach to quantile regression based on convolutional smoothing.</p>

    <p>Early detection of cancers has been much explored due to its paramount
importance in biomedical fields. Among different types of data used to answer
this biological question, studies based on T cell receptors (TCRs) are under
recent spotlight due to the growing appreciation of the roles of the host
immunity system in tumor biology. However, the one-to-many correspondence
between a patient and multiple TCR sequences hinders researchers from simply
adopting classical statistical/machine learning methods. There were recent
attempts to model this type of data in the context of multiple instance
learning (MIL).
Despite the novel application of MIL to cancer detection using TCR sequences
and the demonstrated adequate performance in several tumor types, there is
still room for improvement, especially for certain cancer types. Furthermore,
explainable neural network models are not fully investigated for this
application.
In this article, we propose multiple instance neural networks based on sparse
attention (MINN-SA) to enhance the performance in cancer detection and
explainability. The sparse attention structure drops out uninformative
instances in each bag, achieving both interpretability and better predictive
performance in combination with the skip connection.
Our experiments show that MINN-SA yields the highest area under the ROC curve
(AUC) scores on average measured across 10 different types of cancers, compared
to existing MIL approaches. Moreover, we observe from the estimated attentions
that MINN-SA can identify the TCRs that are specific for tumor antigens in the
same T cell repertoire.</p>

    <p>We propose a sampling method based on an ensemble approximation of second
order Langevin dynamics. The log target density is appended with a quadratic
term in an auxiliary momentum variable and damped-driven Hamiltonian dynamics
introduced; the resulting stochastic differential equation is invariant to the
Gibbs measure, with marginal on the position coordinates given by the target. A
preconditioner based on covariance under the law of the dynamics does not
change this invariance property, and is introduced to accelerate convergence to
the Gibbs measure. The resulting mean-field dynamics may be approximated by an
ensemble method; this results in a gradient-free and affine-invariant
stochastic dynamical system. Numerical results demonstrate its potential as the
basis for a numerical sampler in Bayesian inverse problems.</p>

    <p>Image representation is critical for many visual tasks. Instead of
representing images discretely with 2D arrays of pixels, a recent study, namely
local implicit image function (LIIF), denotes images as a continuous function
where pixel values are expansion by using the corresponding coordinates as
inputs. Due to its continuous nature, LIIF can be adopted for arbitrary-scale
image super-resolution tasks, resulting in a single effective and efficient
model for various up-scaling factors. However, LIIF often suffers from
structural distortions and ringing artifacts around edges, mostly because all
pixels share the same model, thus ignoring the local properties of the image.
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive local image function (A-LIIF) to
alleviate this problem. Specifically, our A-LIIF consists of two main
components: an encoder and a expansion network. The former captures cross-scale
image features, while the latter models the continuous up-scaling function by a
weighted combination of multiple local implicit image functions. Accordingly,
our A-LIIF can reconstruct the high-frequency textures and structures more
accurately. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness
of our method. Our codes are available at

    <p>This paper introduces a deep learning system based on a quantum neural
network for the binary classification of points of a specific geometric pattern
(Two-Moons Classification problem) on a plane. We believe that the use of
hybrid deep learning systems (classical + quantum) can reasonably bring
benefits, not only in terms of computational acceleration but in understanding
the underlying phenomena and mechanisms; that will lead to the creation of new
forms of machine learning, as well as to a strong development in the world of
quantum computation. The chosen dataset is based on a 2D binary classification
generator, which helps test the effectiveness of specific algorithms; it is a
set of 2D points forming two interspersed semicircles. It displays two
disjointed data sets in a two-dimensional representation space: the features
are, therefore, the individual points' two coordinates, $x_1$ and $x_2$. The
intention was to produce a quantum deep neural network with the minimum number
of trainable parameters capable of correctly recognising and classifying

    <p>Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is an important molecule family in the field of
human immunity, which recognizes foreign threats and triggers immune responses
by presenting peptides to T cells. In recent years, the synthesis of tumor
vaccines to induce specific immune responses has become the forefront of cancer
treatment. Computationally modeling the binding patterns between peptide and
HLA can greatly accelerate the development of tumor vaccines. However, most of
the prediction methods performance is very limited and they cannot fully take
advantage of the analysis of existing biological knowledge as the basis of
modeling. In this paper, we propose TripHLApan, a novel pan-specific prediction
model, for HLA molecular peptide binding prediction. TripHLApan exhibits
powerful prediction ability by integrating triple coding matrix, BiGRU +
Attention models, and transfer learning strategy. The comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate the effectiveness of TripHLApan in predicting HLA-I and HLA-II
peptide binding in different test environments. The predictive power of HLA-I
is further demonstrated in the latest data set. In addition, we show that
TripHLApan has strong binding reconstitution ability in the samples of a
melanoma patient. In conclusion, TripHLApan is a powerful tool for predicting
the binding of HLA-I and HLA-II molecular peptides for the synthesis of tumor
vaccines.</p>

    <p>Predicting the novel effects of drugs based on information about approved
drugs can be regarded as a recommendation system. Matrix factorization is one
of the most used recommendation systems and various algorithms have been
devised for it. A literature survey and summary of existing algorithms for
predicting drug effects demonstrated that most such methods, including
neighborhood regularized logistic matrix factorization, which was the best
performer in benchmark tests, used a binary matrix that considers only the
presence or absence of interactions. However, drug effects are known to have
two opposite aspects, such as side effects and therapeutic effects. In the
present study, we proposed using neighborhood regularized bidirectional matrix
factorization (NRBdMF) to predict drug effects by incorporating
bidirectionality, which is a characteristic property of drug effects. We used
this proposed method for predicting side effects using a matrix that considered
the bidirectionality of drug effects, in which known side effects were assigned
a positive label (plus 1) and known treatment effects were assigned a negative
(minus 1) label. The NRBdMF model, which utilizes drug bidirectional
information, achieved enrichment of side effects at the top and indications at
the bottom of the prediction list. This first attempt to consider the
bidirectional nature of drug effects using NRBdMF showed that it reduced false
positives and produced a highly interpretable output.</p>

    <p>Finding the conceptual difference between the two images in an industrial
environment has been especially important for HSE purposes and there is still
no reliable and conformable method to find the major differences to alert the
related controllers. Due to the abundance and variety of objects in different
environments, the use of supervised learning methods in this field is facing a
major problem. Due to the sharp and even slight change in lighting conditions
in the two scenes, it is not possible to naively subtract the two images in
order to find these differences. The goal of this paper is to find and localize
the conceptual differences of two frames of one scene but in two different
times and classify the differences to addition, reduction and change in the
field. In this paper, we demonstrate a comprehensive solution for this
application by presenting the deep learning method and using transfer learning
and structural modification of the error function, as well as a process for
adding and synthesizing data. An appropriate data set was provided and labeled,
and the model results were evaluated on this data set and the possibility of
using it in real and industrial applications was explained.</p>

    <p>Interstellar objects (ISOs), astronomical objects not gravitationally bound
to the Sun, are likely representatives of primitive materials invaluable in
understanding exoplanetary star systems. Due to their poorly constrained orbits
with generally high inclinations and relative velocities, however, exploring
ISOs with conventional human-in-the-loop approaches is significantly
challenging. This paper presents Neural-Rendezvous -- a deep learning-based
guidance and control framework for encountering any fast-moving objects,
including ISOs, robustly, accurately, and autonomously in real-time. It uses
pointwise minimum norm tracking control on top of a guidance policy modeled by
a spectrally-normalized deep neural network, where its hyperparameters are
tuned with a newly introduced loss function directly penalizing the state
trajectory tracking error. We rigorously show that, even in the challenging
case of ISO exploration, Neural-Rendezvous provides 1) a high probability
exponential bound on the expected spacecraft delivery error; and 2) a finite
optimality gap with respect to the solution of model predictive control, both
of which are indispensable especially for such a critical space mission. In
numerical simulations, Neural-Rendezvous is demonstrated to achieve a
terminal-time delivery error of less than 0.2 km for 99% of the ISO candidates
with realistic state uncertainty, whilst retaining computational efficiency
sufficient for real-time implementation.</p>

    <p>Teams are central to human accomplishment. Over the past half-century,
psychologists have identified the Big-Five cross-culturally valid personality
variables: Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Conscientiousness, and
Agreeableness. The first four have shown consistent relationships with team
performance. Agreeableness (being harmonious, altruistic, humble, and
cooperative), however, has demonstrated a non-significant and highly variable
relationship with team performance. We resolve this inconsistency through
computational modelling. An agent-based model (ABM) is used to predict the
effects of personality traits on teamwork and a genetic algorithm is then used
to explore the limits of the ABM in order to discover which traits correlate
with best and worst performing teams for a problem with different levels of
uncertainty (noise). New dependencies revealed by the exploration are
corroborated by analyzing previously-unseen data from one the largest datasets
on team performance to date comprising 3,698 individuals in 593 teams working
on more than 5,000 group tasks with and without uncertainty, collected over a
10-year period. Our finding is that the dependency between team performance and
Agreeableness is moderated by task uncertainty. Combining evolutionary
computation with ABMs in this way provides a new methodology for the scientific
investigation of teamwork, making new predictions, and improving our
understanding of human behaviors. Our results confirm the potential usefulness
of computer modelling for developing theory, as well as shedding light on the
future of teams as work environments are becoming increasingly fluid and

    <p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) reach high accuracies in various
application domains, but require large amounts of computation and incur costly
data movements. One method to decrease these costs while trading accuracy is
weight and/or activation word-length reduction. Thereby, layer-wise
mixed-precision quantization allows for more efficient results while inflating
the design space. In this work, we present an in-depth quantitative methodology
to efficiently explore the design space considering the limited hardware
resources of a given FPGA. Our holistic exploration approach vertically
traverses the various design entry levels from the architectural down to the
logic level, and laterally covers optimization from processing elements to
dataflow for an efficient mixed-precision CNN accelerator. Our resulting
hardware accelerators implement truly mixed-precision operations that enable
efficient execution of layer-wise and channel-wise quantized CNNs. Mapping
feed-forward and identity-shortcut-connection mixed-precision CNNs result in
competitive accuracy-throughout trade-offs: 245 frames/s with 87.48% Top-5
accuracy for ResNet-18 and 92.9% Top-5 accuracy with 1.13 TOps/s for
ResNet-152, respectively. Thereby, the required memory footprint for parameters
is reduced by 4.9x and 9.4x compared to the respective floating-point baseline.</p>

    <p>Large quantifies of online user activity data, such as weekly web search
volumes, which co-evolve with the mutual influence of several queries and
locations, serve as an important social sensor. It is an important task to
accurately forecast the future activity by discovering latent interactions from
such data, i.e., the ecosystems between each query and the flow of influences
between each area. However, this is a difficult problem in terms of data
quantity and complex patterns covering the dynamics. To tackle the problem, we
propose FluxCube, which is an effective mining method that forecasts large
collections of co-evolving online user activity and provides good
interpretability. Our model is the expansion of a combination of two
mathematical models: a reaction-diffusion system provides a framework for
modeling the flow of influences between local area groups and an ecological
system models the latent interactions between each query. Also, by leveraging
the concept of physics-informed neural networks, FluxCube achieves high
interpretability obtained from the parameters and high forecasting performance,
together. Extensive experiments on real datasets showed that FluxCube
outperforms comparable models in terms of the forecasting accuracy, and each
component in FluxCube contributes to the enhanced performance. We then show
some case studies that FluxCube can extract useful latent interactions between
queries and area groups.</p>

    <p>The initial years of an infant's life are known as the critical period,
during which the overall development of learning performance is significantly
impacted due to neural plasticity. In recent studies, an AI agent, with a deep
neural network mimicking mechanisms of actual neurons, exhibited a learning
period similar to human's critical period. Especially during this initial
period, the appropriate stimuli play a vital role in developing learning
ability. However, transforming human cognitive bias into an appropriate shaping
reward is quite challenging, and prior works on critical period do not focus on
finding the appropriate stimulus. To take a step further, we propose
multi-stage reinforcement learning to emphasize finding ``appropriate stimulus"
around the critical period. Inspired by humans' early cognitive-developmental
stage, we use multi-stage guidance near the critical period, and demonstrate
the appropriate shaping reward (stage-2 guidance) in terms of the AI agent's
performance, efficiency, and stability.</p>

    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>
    <p>Learning a control policy that involves time-varying and evolving system
dynamics often poses a great challenge to mainstream reinforcement learning
algorithms. In most standard methods, actions are often assumed to be a rigid,
fixed set of choices that are sequentially applied to the state space in a
predefined manner. Consequently, without resorting to substantial re-learning
processes, the learned policy lacks the ability in adapting to variations in
the action set and the action's "behavioral" outcomes. In addition, the
standard action representation and the action-induced state transition
mechanism inherently limit how reinforcement learning can be applied in
complex, real-world applications primarily due to the intractability of the
resulting large state space and the lack of facility to generalize the learned
policy to the unknown part of the state space. This paper proposes a
Bayesian-flavored generalized reinforcement learning framework by first
establishing the notion of parametric action model to better cope with
uncertainty and fluid action behaviors, followed by introducing the notion of
reinforcement field as a physics-inspired construct established through
"polarized experience particles" maintained in the learning agent's working
memory. These particles effectively encode the dynamic learning experience that
evolves over time in a self-organizing way. On top of the reinforcement field,
we will further generalize the policy learning process to incorporate
high-level decision concepts by considering the past memory as having an
implicit graph structure, in which the past memory instances (or particles) are
interconnected with similarity between decisions defined, and thereby, the
"associative memory" principle can be applied to augment the learning agent's

    <p>Graph data management and querying has many practical applications. When
graphs are very heterogeneous and/or users are unfamiliar with their structure,
they may need to find how two or more groups of nodes are connected in a graph,
even when users are not able to describe the connections. This is only
partially supported by existing query languages, which allow searching for
paths, but not for trees connecting three or more node groups. The latter is
related to the NP-hard Group Steiner Tree problem, and has been previously
considered for keyword search in databases. In this work, we formally show how
to integrate connecting tree patterns (CTPs, in short) within a graph query
language such as SPARQL or Cypher, leading to an Extended Query Language (or
EQL, in short). We then study a set of algorithms for evaluating CTPs; we
generalize prior keyword search work, most importantly by (i) considering
bidirectional edge traversal and (ii) allowing users to select any score
function for ranking CTP results. To cope with very large search spaces, we
propose an efficient pruning technique and formally establish a large set of
cases where our algorithm, MOLESP, is complete even with pruning. Our
experiments validate the performance of our CTP and EQL evaluation algorithms
on a large set of synthetic and real-world workloads.</p>

    <p>Exploiting gradient leakage to reconstruct supposedly private training data,
gradient inversion attacks are an ubiquitous threat in collaborative learning
of neural networks. To prevent gradient leakage without suffering from severe
loss in model performance, recent work proposed a PRivacy EnhanCing mODulE
(PRECODE) based on variational modeling as extension for arbitrary model
architectures. In this work, we investigate the effect of PRECODE on gradient
inversion attacks to reveal its underlying working principle. We show that
variational modeling induces stochasticity on PRECODE's and its subsequent
layers' gradients that prevents gradient attacks from convergence. By
purposefully omitting those stochastic gradients during attack optimization, we
formulate an attack that can disable PRECODE's privacy preserving effects. To
ensure privacy preservation against such targeted attacks, we propose PRECODE
with Partial Perturbation (PPP), as strategic combination of variational
modeling and partial gradient perturbation. We conduct an extensive empirical
study on four seminal model architectures and two image classification
datasets. We find all architectures to be prone to gradient leakage, which can
be prevented by PPP. In result, we show that our approach requires less
gradient perturbation to effectively preserve privacy without harming model
performance.</p>

    <p>This report documents the history of research on AI rights and other moral
consideration of artificial entities. It highlights key intellectual influences
on this literature as well as research and academic discussion addressing the
topic more directly. We find that researchers addressing AI rights have often
seemed to be unaware of the work of colleagues whose interests overlap with
their own. Academic interest in this topic has grown substantially in recent
years; this reflects wider trends in academic research, but it seems that
certain influential publications, the gradual, accumulating ubiquity of AI and
robotic technology, and relevant news events may all have encouraged increased
academic interest in this specific topic. We suggest four levers that, if
pulled on in the future, might increase interest further: the adoption of
publication strategies similar to those of the most successful previous
contributors; increased engagement with adjacent academic fields and debates;
the creation of specialized journals, conferences, and research institutions;
and more exploration of legal rights for artificial entities.</p>

    <p>Adaptive learning aims to stimulate and meet the needs of individual
learners, which requires sophisticated system-level coordination of diverse
tasks, including modeling learning resources, estimating student states, and
making personalized recommendations. Existing deep learning methods have
achieved great success over statistical models; however, they still lack
generalization for diverse tasks and suffer from insufficient capacity since
they are composed of highly-coupled task-specific architectures and rely on
small-scale, coarse-grained recommendation scenarios. To realize the idea of
general adaptive systems proposed in pedagogical theory, with the emerging
pre-training techniques in NLP, we try to conduct a practical exploration on
applying pre-training to adaptive learning, to propose a unified framework
based on data observation and learning style analysis, properly leveraging
heterogeneous learning elements. Through a series of downstream tasks of
Learning Recommendation, Learning Resource Evaluation, Knowledge Tracing, and
Dropout Prediction, we find that course structures, text, and knowledge are
helpful for modeling and inherently coherent to student non-sequential learning
behaviors and that indirectly relevant information included in the pre-training
foundation can be shared across downstream tasks to facilitate effectiveness.
We finally build a simplified systematic application of adaptive learning and
reflect on the insights brought back to pedagogy. The source code and dataset
will be released.</p>

    <p>In modern dynamic constantly developing society, more and more people suffer
from chronic and serious diseases and doctors and patients need special and
sophisticated medical and health support. Accordingly, prominent health
stakeholders have recognized the importance of development of such services to
make patients life easier. Such support requires the collection of huge amount
of patients complex data like clinical, environmental, nutritional, daily
activities, variety of data from smart wearable devices, data from clothing
equipped with sensors etc. Holistic patients data must be properly aggregated,
processed, analyzed, and presented to the doctors and caregivers to recommend
adequate treatment and actions to improve patients health related parameters
and general wellbeing. Advanced artificial intelligence techniques offer the
opportunity to analyze such big data, consume them, and derive new knowledge to
support personalized medical decisions. New approaches like those based on
advanced machine learning, federated learning, transfer learning, explainable
artificial intelligence open new paths for more quality use of health and

    <p>Learning to derive subgoals reduces the gap between experts and students and
makes students prepared for future problem solving. Researchers have explored
subgoal labeled instructional materials with explanations in traditional
problem solving and within tutoring systems to help novices learn to subgoal.
However, only a little research is found on problem-solving strategies in
relationship with subgoal learning. Also, these strategies are under-explored
within computer-based tutors and learning environments. Backward
problem-solving strategy is closely related to the process of subgoaling, where
problem solving iteratively refines the goal into a new subgoal to reduce
difficulty. In this paper, we explore a training strategy for backward strategy
learning within an intelligent logic tutor that teaches logic proof
construction. The training session involved backward worked examples (BWE) and
problem-solving (BPS) to help students learn backward strategy towards
improving their subgoaling and problem-solving skills. To evaluate the training
strategy, we analyzed students' 1) experience with and engagement in learning
backward strategy, 2) performance, and 3) proof construction approaches in new
problems that they solved independently without tutor help after each level of
training and in post-test. Our results showed that, when new problems were
given to solve without any tutor help, students who were trained with both BWE
and BPS outperformed students who received none of the treatment or only BWE
during training. Additionally, students trained with both BWE and BPS derived
subgoals during proof construction with significantly higher efficiency than
the other two groups.</p>

    <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing public health threat, estimated
to cause over 10 million deaths per year and cost the global economy 100
trillion USD by 2050 under status quo projections. These losses would mainly
result from an increase in the morbidity and mortality from treatment failure,
AMR infections during medical procedures, and a loss of quality of life
attributed to AMR. Numerous interventions have been proposed to control the
development of AMR and mitigate the risks posed by its spread. This paper
reviews key aspects of bacterial AMR management and control which make
essential use of data technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine
learning, and mathematical and statistical modelling, fields that have seen
rapid developments in this century. Although data technologies have become an
integral part of biomedical research, their impact on AMR management has
remained modest. We outline the use of data technologies to combat AMR,
detailing recent advancements in four complementary categories: surveillance,
prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. We provide an overview on current AMR
control approaches using data technologies within biomedical research, clinical
practice, and in the "One Health" context. We discuss the potential impact and
challenges wider implementation of data technologies is facing in high-income
as well as in low- and middle-income countries, and recommend concrete actions
needed to allow these technologies to be more readily integrated within the

    <p>With the rapid development of natural language processing (NLP) technology,
NLP models have shown great economic value in business. However, the owner's
models are vulnerable to the threat of pirated redistribution, which breaks the
symmetry relationship between model owners and consumers. Therefore, a model
protection mechanism is needed to keep the symmetry from being broken.
Currently, language model protection schemes based on black-box verification
perform poorly in terms of invisibility of trigger samples, which are easily
detected by humans or anomaly detectors and thus prevent verification. To solve
this problem, this paper proposes a trigger sample of the triggerless mode for
ownership verification. In addition, a thief may replace the classification
module for a watermarked model to satisfy its specific classification task and
remove the watermark present in the model. Therefore, this paper further
proposes a new threat of replacing the model classification module and
performing global fine-tuning of the model, and successfully verifies the model
ownership through a white-box approach. Meanwhile, we use the properties of
blockchain such as tamper-proof and traceability to prevent the ownership
statement of thieves. Experiments show that the proposed scheme successfully
verifies ownership with 100% watermark verification accuracy without affecting
the original performance of the model, and has strong robustness and low False
trigger rate.</p>

factors such as teaching experience, academic training, competition, etc. are
considered. This work is usually done by experts, such as faculty directors,
which is time consuming. Up to now, several semi-automatic systems have been
proposed to assist heads. In this article, a fully automatic rule-based expert
system is developed. The proposed expert system consists of three main stages.
First, the knowledge of human experts is entered and designed as a decision
tree. In the second step, an expert system is designed based on the provided
rules of the generated decision tree. In the third step, an algorithm is
proposed to weight the results of the tree based on the quality of the experts.
To improve the performance of the expert system, a majority voting algorithm is
developed as a post-process step to select the qualified trainer who satisfies
the most expert decision tree for each course. The quality of the proposed
expert system is evaluated using real data from Iranian universities. The
calculated accuracy rate is 85.55, demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of
the proposed system. The proposed system has little computational complexity
compared to related efficient works. Also, simple implementation and
transparent box are other features of the proposed system.</p>

    <p>Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) seeks to produce explanations for
those machine learning methods which are deemed opaque. However, there is
considerable disagreement about what this means and how to achieve it. Authors
disagree on what should be explained (topic), to whom something should be

why something should be explained (goal). In this paper, I employ insights from
means-end epistemology to structure the field. According to means-end
epistemology, different means ought to be rationally adopted to achieve
different epistemic ends. Applied to XAI, different topics, stakeholders, and
goals thus require different instruments. I call this the means-end account of
XAI. The means-end account has a descriptive and a normative component: on the
one hand, I show how the specific means-end relations give rise to a taxonomy
of existing contributions to the field of XAI; on the other hand, I argue that
the suitability of XAI methods can be assessed by analyzing whether they are

share concepts between them and might use words with different meanings, or
even use the same words differently. Additionally, experts from different
disciplines might not be aware of specialized terms readily used in other

identify when experts from different disciplines talk about the same problem

    <p>Estimating long-term causal effects based on short-term surrogates is a
significant but challenging problem in many real-world applications, e.g.,
marketing and medicine. Despite its success in certain domains, most existing
methods estimate causal effects in an idealistic and simplistic way - ignoring
the causal structure among short-term outcomes and treating all of them as
surrogates. However, such methods cannot be well applied to real-world
scenarios, in which the partially observed surrogates are mixed with their
proxies among short-term outcomes. To this end, we develop our flexible method,
Laser, to estimate long-term causal effects in the more realistic situation
that the surrogates are observed or have observed proxies.Given the
indistinguishability between the surrogates and proxies, we utilize
identifiable variational auto-encoder (iVAE) to recover the whole valid
surrogates on all the surrogates candidates without the need of distinguishing
the observed surrogates or the proxies of latent surrogates. With the help of
the recovered surrogates, we further devise an unbiased estimation of long-term
causal effects. Extensive experimental results on the real-world and
semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p>

    <p>Pruning techniques are used comprehensively to compress convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) on image classification. However, the majority of pruning
methods require a well pre-trained model to provide useful supporting
parameters, such as C1-norm, BatchNorm value and gradient information, which
may lead to inconsistency of filter evaluation if the parameters of the
pre-trained model are not well optimized. Therefore, we propose a sensitiveness
based method to evaluate the importance of each layer from the perspective of
inference accuracy by adding extra damage for the original model. Because the
performance of the accuracy is determined by the distribution of parameters
across all layers rather than individual parameter, the sensitiveness based
method will be robust to update of parameters. Namely, we can obtain similar
importance evaluation of each convolutional layer between the imperfect-trained
and fully trained models. For VGG-16 on CIFAR-10, even when the original model
is only trained with 50 epochs, we can get same evaluation of layer importance
as the results when the model is trained fully. Then we will remove filters
proportional from each layer by the quantified sensitiveness. Our sensitiveness
based pruning framework is verified efficiently on VGG-16, a customized Conv-4
and ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10, MNIST and CIFAR-100, respectively.</p>

    <p>Graph similarity measurement, which computes the distance/similarity between
two graphs, arises in various graph-related tasks. Recent learning-based
methods lack interpretability, as they directly transform interaction
information between two graphs into one hidden vector and then map it to
similarity. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a more interpretable
end-to-end paradigm for graph similarity learning, named Similarity Computation
via Maximum Common Subgraph Inference (INFMCS). Our critical insight into
INFMCS is the strong correlation between similarity score and Maximum Common
Subgraph (MCS). We implicitly infer MCS to obtain the normalized MCS size, with
the supervision information being only the similarity score during training. To
capture more global information, we also stack some vanilla transformer encoder
layers with graph convolution layers and propose a novel permutation-invariant
node Positional Encoding. The entire model is quite simple yet effective.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that INFMCS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines for graph-graph classification and regression tasks.
Ablation experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed computation
paradigm and other components. Also, visualization and statistics of results
reveal the interpretability of INFMCS.</p>

    <p>African languages have recently been the subject of several studies in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and, this has caused a significant increase
in their representation in the field. However, most studies tend to focus more
on the models than the quality of the datasets when assessing the models'
performance in tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). While this works
well in most cases, it does not account for the limitations of doing NLP with
low-resource languages, that is, the quality and the quantity of the dataset at
our disposal. This paper provides an analysis of the performance of various
models based on the quality of the dataset. We evaluate different pre-trained
models with respect to the entity density per sentence of some African NER
datasets. We hope with this study to improve the way NLP studies are done in
the context of low-resourced languages.</p>

    <p>Recommender System (RS) is an important online application that affects
billions of users every day. The mainstream RS ranking framework is composed of
two parts: a Multi-Task Learning model (MTL) that predicts various user
feedback, i.e., clicks, likes, sharings, and a Multi-Task Fusion model (MTF)
that combines the multi-task outputs into one final ranking score with respect
to user satisfaction. There has not been much research on the fusion model
while it has great impact on the final recommendation as the last crucial
process of the ranking. To optimize long-term user satisfaction rather than
obtain instant returns greedily, we formulate MTF task as Markov Decision
Process (MDP) within a recommendation session and propose a Batch Reinforcement
Learning (RL) based Multi-Task Fusion framework (BatchRL-MTF) that includes a
Batch RL framework and an online exploration. The former exploits Batch RL to
learn an optimal recommendation policy from the fixed batch data offline for
long-term user satisfaction, while the latter explores potential high-value
actions online to break through the local optimal dilemma. With a comprehensive
investigation on user behaviors, we model the user satisfaction reward with
subtle heuristics from two aspects of user stickiness and user activeness.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on a billion-sample level real-world
dataset to show the effectiveness of our model. We propose a conservative
offline policy estimator (Conservative-OPEstimator) to test our model offline.
Furthermore, we take online experiments in a real recommendation environment to
compare performance of different models. As one of few Batch RL researches
applied in MTF task successfully, our model has also been deployed on a
large-scale industrial short video platform, serving hundreds of millions of
users.</p>

    <p>Simulation has played an important role in efficiently evaluating
self-driving vehicles in terms of scalability. Existing methods mostly rely on
heuristic-based simulation, where traffic participants follow certain
human-encoded rules that fail to generate complex human behaviors. Therefore,
the reactive simulation concept is proposed to bridge the human behavior gap
between simulation and real-world traffic scenarios by leveraging real-world
data. However, these reactive models can easily generate unreasonable behaviors
after a few steps of simulation, where we regard the model as losing its
stability. To the best of our knowledge, no work has explicitly discussed and
analyzed the stability of the reactive simulation framework. In this paper, we
aim to provide a thorough stability analysis of the reactive simulation and
propose a solution to enhance the stability. Specifically, we first propose a
new reactive simulation framework, where we discover that the smoothness and
consistency of the simulated state sequences are crucial factors to stability.
We then incorporate the kinematic vehicle model into the framework to improve
the closed-loop stability of the reactive simulation. Furthermore, along with
commonly-used metrics, several novel metrics are proposed in this paper to
better analyze the simulation performance.</p>

    <p>Data-to-text (D2T) generation is the task of generating texts from structured
inputs. We observed that when the same target sentence was repeated twice,
Transformer (T5) based model generates an output made up of asymmetric
sentences from structured inputs. In other words, these sentences were
different in length and quality. We call this phenomenon "Asymmetric
Generation" and we exploit this in D2T generation. Once asymmetric sentences
are generated, we add the first part of the output with a no-repeated-target.
As this goes through progressive edit (ProEdit), the recall increases. Hence,
this method better covers structured inputs than before editing. ProEdit is a
simple but effective way to improve performance in D2T generation and it
achieves the new stateof-the-art result on the ToTTo dataset</p>

    <p>Predicting future behaviors of road agents is a key task in autonomous
driving. While existing models have demonstrated great success in predicting
marginal agent future behaviors, it remains a challenge to efficiently predict
consistent joint behaviors of multiple agents. Recently, the occupancy flow
fields representation was proposed to represent joint future states of road
agents through a combination of occupancy grid and flow, which supports
efficient and consistent joint predictions. In this work, we propose a novel
occupancy flow fields predictor to produce accurate occupancy and flow
predictions, by combining the power of an image encoder that learns features
from a rasterized traffic image and a vector encoder that captures information
of continuous agent trajectories and map states. The two encoded features are
fused by multiple attention modules before generating final predictions. Our
simple but effective model ranks 3rd place on the Waymo Open Dataset Occupancy
and Flow Prediction Challenge, and achieves the best performance in the
occluded occupancy and flow prediction task.</p>

    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>
    <p>Lip reading aims to predict speech based on lip movements alone. As it
focuses on visual information to model the speech, its performance is
inherently sensitive to personal lip appearances and movements. This makes the
lip reading models show degraded performance when they are applied to unseen
speakers due to the mismatch between training and testing conditions. Speaker
adaptation technique aims to reduce this mismatch between train and test
speakers, thus guiding a trained model to focus on modeling the speech content
without being intervened by the speaker variations. In contrast to the efforts
made in audio-based speech recognition for decades, the speaker adaptation
methods have not well been studied in lip reading. In this paper, to remedy the
performance degradation of lip reading model on unseen speakers, we propose a
speaker-adaptive lip reading method, namely user-dependent padding. The
user-dependent padding is a speaker-specific input that can participate in the
visual feature extraction stage of a pre-trained lip reading model. Therefore,
the lip appearances and movements information of different speakers can be
considered during the visual feature encoding, adaptively for individual
speakers. Moreover, the proposed method does not need 1) any additional layers,
2) to modify the learned weights of the pre-trained model, and 3) the speaker
label of train data used during pre-train. It can directly adapt to unseen
speakers by learning the user-dependent padding only, in a supervised or
unsupervised manner. Finally, to alleviate the speaker information
insufficiency in public lip reading databases, we label the speaker of a
well-known audio-visual database, LRW, and design an unseen-speaker lip reading
scenario named LRW-ID.</p>

    <p>Denoising is the process of removing noise from sound signals while improving
the quality and adequacy of the sound signals. Denoising sound has many
applications in speech processing, sound events classification, and machine
failure detection systems. This paper describes a method for creating an
autoencoder to map noisy machine sounds to clean sounds for denoising purposes.
There are several types of noise in sounds, for example, environmental noise
and generated frequency-dependent noise from signal processing methods. Noise
generated by environmental activities is environmental noise. In the factory,
environmental noise can be created by vehicles, drilling, people working or
talking in the survey area, wind, and flowing water. Those noises appear as
spikes in the sound record. In the scope of this paper, we demonstrate the
removal of generated noise with Gaussian distribution and the environmental
noise with a specific example of the water sink faucet noise from the induction
motor sounds. The proposed method was trained and verified on 49 normal
function sounds and 197 horizontal misalignment fault sounds from the Machinery
Fault Database (MAFAULDA). The mean square error (MSE) was used as the
assessment criteria to evaluate the similarity between denoised sounds using
the proposed autoencoder and the original sounds in the test set. The MSE is
below or equal to 0.14 when denoise both types of noises on 15 testing sounds
of the normal function category. The MSE is below or equal to 0.15 when
denoising 60 testing sounds on the horizontal misalignment fault category. The
low MSE shows that both the generated Gaussian noise and the environmental
noise were almost removed from the original sounds with the proposed trained
autoencoder.</p>

    <p>This paper concerns pseudo labelling in segmentation. Our contribution is
fourfold. Firstly, we present a new formulation of pseudo-labelling as an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for clear statistical interpretation.
Secondly, we propose a semi-supervised medical image segmentation method purely
based on the original pseudo labelling, namely SegPL. We demonstrate SegPL is a
competitive approach against state-of-the-art consistency regularisation based
methods on semi-supervised segmentation on a 2D multi-class MRI brain tumour
segmentation task and a 3D binary CT lung vessel segmentation task. The
simplicity of SegPL allows less computational cost comparing to prior methods.
Thirdly, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of SegPL may originate from its
robustness against out-of-distribution noises and adversarial attacks. Lastly,
under the EM framework, we introduce a probabilistic generalisation of SegPL
via variational inference, which learns a dynamic threshold for pseudo
labelling during the training. We show that SegPL with variational inference
can perform uncertainty estimation on par with the gold-standard method Deep
Ensemble.</p>

found only the weakest bias in the more recent Instruct Series version of
GPT-3, fine-tuned to eliminate biased and toxic outputs. Few violent
completions were observed. Additional pre-registered experiments, however,
showed that using common names associated with the religions in prompts yields
a highly significant increase in violent completions, also revealing a stronger
second-order bias against Muslims. Names of Muslim celebrities from non-violent
domains resulted in relatively fewer violent completions, suggesting that
access to individualized information can steer the model away from using
stereotypes. Nonetheless, content analysis revealed religion-specific violent
themes containing highly offensive ideas regardless of prompt format. Our
results show the need for additional debiasing of large language models to

    <p>With the future striving toward data-centric decision-making, seamless access
to databases is of utmost importance. There is extensive research on creating
an efficient text-to-sql (TEXT2SQL) model to access data from the database.
Using a Natural language is one of the best interfaces that can bridge the gap
between the data and results by accessing the database efficiently, especially
for non-technical users. It will open the doors and create tremendous interest
among users who are well versed in technical skills or not very skilled in
query languages. Even if numerous deep learning-based algorithms are proposed
or studied, there still is very challenging to have a generic model to solve
the data query issues using natural language in a real-work scenario. The
reason is the use of different datasets in different studies, which comes with
its limitations and assumptions. At the same time, we do lack a thorough
understanding of these proposed models and their limitations with the specific
dataset it is trained on. In this paper, we try to present a holistic overview
of 24 recent neural network models studied in the last couple of years,
including their architectures involving convolutional neural networks,
recurrent neural networks, pointer networks, reinforcement learning, generative
models, etc. We also give an overview of the 11 datasets that are widely used
to train the models for TEXT2SQL technologies. We also discuss the future

    <p>During the operation of a chemical plant, product quality must be
consistently maintained, and the production of off-specification products
should be minimized. Accordingly, process variables related to the product
quality, such as the temperature and composition of materials at various parts
of the plant must be measured, and appropriate operations (that is, control)
must be performed based on the measurements. Some process variables, such as
temperature and flow rate, can be measured continuously and instantaneously.
However, other variables, such as composition and viscosity, can only be
obtained through time-consuming analysis after sampling substances from the
plant. Soft sensors have been proposed for estimating process variables that
cannot be obtained in real time from easily measurable variables. However, the
estimation accuracy of conventional statistical soft sensors, which are
constructed from recorded measurements, can be very poor in unrecorded
situations (extrapolation). In this study, we estimate the internal state
variables of a plant by using a dynamic simulator that can estimate and predict
even unrecorded situations on the basis of chemical engineering knowledge and
an artificial intelligence (AI) technology called reinforcement learning, and
propose to use the estimated internal state variables of a plant as soft
sensors. In addition, we describe the prospects for plant operation and control
using such soft sensors and the methodology to obtain the necessary prediction
models (i.e., simulators) for the proposed system.</p>

    <p>Dysphonia is one of the early symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Most
existing methods use feature selection methods to find the optimal subset of
voice features for all PD patients to improve the prediction performance. Few
have considered the heterogeneity between patients, which implies the need to
provide specific prediction models for different patients. However, building
this prediction model for each patient faces the challenge of small sample
size, which makes it lack generalization ability. Instance transfer is an
effective way to make up for this deficiency. Therefore, this paper proposes a
patient-specific game-based transfer (PSGT) method for PD severity prediction.
First, a selection mechanism is used to select PD patients with similar disease
trends to the target patient from the source domain, which greatly reduces the
scope of instance transfer and reduces the risk of negative transfer. Then, the
contribution of the transferred subjects and their instances to the disease
estimation of the target subject is fairly evaluated by the Shapley value,
which improves the interpretability of the method. Next, the proportion of
valid instances is determined according to the contribution of transferred
subjects, and the instances with higher contribution are transferred based on
this proportion to further reduce the difference between the transferred
instance subset and the target subject. Finally, the selected subset of
instances is added to the training set of the target subject, and the extended
data is fed into the random forest to improve the performance of the PD
severity prediction method. Parkinson's telemonitoring dataset is used to
evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness. Experiment results show that the
proposed PSGT method has better performance in both prediction error and
stability over compared methods.</p>

    <p>Time series shapelets are discriminative subsequences that have been recently
found effective for time series clustering (TSC). The shapelets are convenient
for interpreting the clusters. Thus, the main challenge for TSC is to discover
high-quality variable-length shapelets to discriminate different clusters. In
this paper, we propose a novel autoencoder-shapelet approach (AUTOSHAPE), which
is the first study to take the advantage of both autoencoder and shapelet for
determining shapelets in an unsupervised manner. An autoencoder is specially
designed to learn high-quality shapelets. More specifically, for guiding the
latent representation learning, we employ the latest self-supervised loss to
learn the unified embeddings for variable-length shapelet candidates (time
series subsequences) of different variables, and propose the diversity loss to
select the discriminating embeddings in the unified space. We introduce the
reconstruction loss to recover shapelets in the original time series space for
clustering. Finally, we adopt Davies Bouldin index (DBI) to inform AUTOSHAPE of
the clustering performance during learning. We present extensive experiments on
AUTOSHAPE. To evaluate the clustering performance on univariate time series
(UTS), we compare AUTOSHAPE with 15 representative methods using UCR archive
datasets. To study the performance of multivariate time series (MTS), we
evaluate AUTOSHAPE on 30 UEA archive datasets with 5 competitive methods. The
results validate that AUTOSHAPE is the best among all the methods compared. We
interpret clusters with shapelets, and can obtain interesting intuitions about
clusters in three UTS case studies and one MTS case study, respectively.</p>

    <p>Although principles of neuroscience like reinforcement learning, visual
perception and attention have been applied in machine learning models, there is
a huge gap between machine learning and mammalian learning. Based on the
advances in neuroscience, we propose the context sequence theory to give a
common explanation for multiple types of learning in mammals and hope that can
provide a new insight into the construct of machine learning models.</p>

    <p>Image representation is critical for many visual tasks. Instead of
representing images discretely with 2D arrays of pixels, a recent study, namely
local implicit image function (LIIF), denotes images as a continuous function
where pixel values are expansion by using the corresponding coordinates as
inputs. Due to its continuous nature, LIIF can be adopted for arbitrary-scale
image super-resolution tasks, resulting in a single effective and efficient
model for various up-scaling factors. However, LIIF often suffers from
structural distortions and ringing artifacts around edges, mostly because all
pixels share the same model, thus ignoring the local properties of the image.
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive local image function (A-LIIF) to
alleviate this problem. Specifically, our A-LIIF consists of two main
components: an encoder and a expansion network. The former captures cross-scale
image features, while the latter models the continuous up-scaling function by a
weighted combination of multiple local implicit image functions. Accordingly,
our A-LIIF can reconstruct the high-frequency textures and structures more
accurately. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness
of our method. Our codes are available at
\url{this https URL}.</p>
