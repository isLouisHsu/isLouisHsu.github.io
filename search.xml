Despite the decent performance,existing text-video retrieval models in vision and language communities areimpractical for large-scale Web search because they adopt brute-force searchbased on high-dimensional embeddings. To improve efficiency, Web search engineswidely apply vector compression libraries (e.g., FAISS) to post-process thelearned embeddings. Unfortunately, separate compression from feature encodingdegrades the robustness of representations and incurs performance decay. Topursue a better balance between performance and efficiency, we propose thefirst quantized representation learning method for cross-view video retrieval,namely Hybrid Contrastive Quantization (HCQ). Specifically, HCQ learns bothcoarse-grained and fine-grained quantizations with transformers, which providecomplementary understandings for texts and videos and preserve comprehensivesemantic information. By performing Asymmetric-Quantized Contrastive Learning(AQ-CL) across views, HCQ aligns texts and videos at coarse-grained andmultiple fine-grained levels. This hybrid-grained learning strategy serves asstrong supervision on the cross-view video quantization model, wherecontrastive learning at different levels can be mutually promoted. Extensiveexperiments on three Web video benchmark datasets demonstrate that HCQ achievescompetitive performance with state-of-the-art non-compressed retrieval methodswhile showing high efficiency in storage and computation.

CIM uses an auxiliary generator with a small trainable BEiT tocorrupt the input image instead of using artificial mask tokens, where somepatches are randomly selected and replaced with plausible alternatives sampledfrom the BEiT output distribution. Given this corrupted image, an enhancernetwork learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predictwhether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. Thegenerator and the enhancer are simultaneously trained and synergisticallyupdated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visualencoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-trainingframework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the firsttime, CIM demonstrates that both ViT and CNN can learn rich visualrepresentations using a unified, non-Siamese framework. Experimental resultsshow that our approach achieves compelling results in vision benchmarks, suchas ImageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation. For example,300-epoch CIM pre-trained vanilla ViT-Base/16 and ResNet-50 obtain 83.3 and80.6 Top-1 fine-tuning accuracy on ImageNet-1K image classificationrespectively.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>3. <b>标题：Benchmarking and Analyzing Point Cloud Classification under Corruptions</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[15]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03377</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Jiawei Ren,  Liang Pan,  Ziwei Liu</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Code and dataset are available at this https URL</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：proposed techniques could spark future research, although point cloud classification performance improves, enhance point cloud classifier robustness, especially point cloud classification, analyze point cloud classification</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>3D perception, especially point cloud classification, has achievedsubstantial progress. However, in real-world deployment, point cloudcorruptions are inevitable due to the scene complexity, sensor inaccuracy, andprocessing imprecision. In this work, we aim to rigorously benchmark andanalyze point cloud classification under corruptions. To conduct a systematicinvestigation, we first provide a taxonomy of common 3D corruptions andidentify the atomic corruptions. Then, we perform a comprehensive evaluation ona wide range of representative point cloud models to understand theirrobustness and generalizability. Our benchmark results show that although pointcloud classification performance improves over time, the state-of-the-artmethods are on the verge of being less robust. Based on the obtainedobservations, we propose several effective techniques to enhance point cloudclassifier robustness. We hope our comprehensive benchmark, in-depth analysis,and proposed techniques could spark future research in robust 3D perception.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>4. <b>标题：Message Passing Neural PDE Solvers</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[16]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03376</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Johannes Brandstetter,  Daniel Worrall,  Max Welling</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Published at ICLR 2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：accurate performance across different domain topologies, neural message passing solvers representationally contain, build neural -- numerical hybrid solvers, modern trend towards fully end, optimized neural function approximators</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) is difficult,having led to a century of research so far. Recently, there have been pushes tobuild neural--numerical hybrid solvers, which piggy-backs the modern trendtowards fully end-to-end learned systems. Most works so far can only generalizeover a subset of properties to which a generic solver would be faced,including: resolution, topology, geometry, boundary conditions, domaindiscretization regularity, dimensionality, etc. In this work, we build asolver, satisfying these properties, where all the components are based onneural message passing, replacing all heuristically designed components in thecomputation graph with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. Weshow that neural message passing solvers representationally contain someclassical methods, such as finite differences, finite volumes, and WENOschemes. In order to encourage stability in training autoregressive models, weput forward a method that is based on the principle of zero-stability, posingstability as a domain adaptation problem. We validate our method on variousfluid-like flow problems, demonstrating fast, stable, and accurate performanceacross different domain topologies, discretization, etc. in 1D and 2D. Ourmodel outperforms state-of-the-art numerical solvers in the low resolutionregime in terms of speed and accuracy.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>5. <b>标题：Simple Control Baselines for Evaluating Transfer Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[19]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03365</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Andrei Atanov,  Shijian Xu,  Onur Beker,  Andrei Filatov,  Amir Zamir</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Project website: this https URL</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：skewed towards image classification tasks versus dense pixel, simple yet critical control baselines, dataset bias ), scratch, communicate transfer learning performance, example empirical study investigating</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Transfer learning has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years, forexample, with the introduction of augmentation-based contrastiveself-supervised learning methods. While a number of large-scale empiricalstudies on the transfer performance of such models have been conducted, thereis not yet an agreed-upon set of control baselines, evaluation practices, andmetrics to report, which often hinders a nuanced and calibrated understandingof the real efficacy of the methods. We share an evaluation standard that aimsto quantify and communicate transfer learning performance in an informative andaccessible setup. This is done by baking a number of simple yet criticalcontrol baselines in the evaluation method, particularly the blind-guess(quantifying the dataset bias), scratch-model (quantifying the architecturalcontribution), and maximal-supervision (quantifying the upper-bound). Todemonstrate how the evaluation standard can be employed, we provide an exampleempirical study investigating a few basic questions about self-supervisedlearning. For example, using this standard, the study shows the effectivenessof existing self-supervised pre-training methods is skewed towards imageclassification tasks versus dense pixel-wise predictions.

Such issues arise from the overfitting issue, which we discover fromour own analysis and the previous studies to originate from the frequency-levelartifacts in generated images. We find that ignoring the frequency-levelartifacts can improve the detector's generalization across various GAN models,but it can reduce the model's performance for the trained GAN models. Thus, wedesign a framework to generalize the deepfake detector for both the known andunseen GAN models. Our framework generates the frequency-level perturbationmaps to make the generated images indistinguishable from the real images. Byupdating the deepfake detector along with the training of the perturbationgenerator, our model is trained to detect the frequency-level artifacts at theinitial iterations and consider the image-level irregularities at the lastiterations. For experiments, we design new test scenarios varying from thetraining settings in GAN models, color manipulations, and object categories.Numerous experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of our deepfakedetector.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>7. <b>标题：CZU-MHAD: A multimodal dataset for human action recognition utilizing a  depth camera and 10 wearable inertial sensors</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[48]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03283</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Xin Chao,  Zhenjie Hou,  Yujian Mo</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：three modals temporal synchronized data, modal human action dataset )., modals include depth videos, 10 main motion joints, many human action datasets</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Human action recognition has been widely used in many fields of life, andmany human action datasets have been published at the same time. However, mostof the multi-modal databases have some shortcomings in the layout and number ofsensors, which cannot fully represent the action features. Regarding theproblems, this paper proposes a freely available dataset, named CZU-MHAD(Changzhou University: a comprehensive multi-modal human action dataset). Itconsists of 22 actions and three modals temporal synchronized data. Thesemodals include depth videos and skeleton positions from a kinect v2 camera, andinertial signals from 10 wearable sensors. Compared with single modal sensors,multi-modal sensors can collect different modal data, so the use of multi-modalsensors can describe actions more accurately. Moreover, CZU-MHAD obtains the3-axis acceleration and 3-axis angular velocity of 10 main motion joints bybinding inertial sensors to them, and these data were captured at the sametime. Experimental results are provided to show that this dataset can be usedto study structural relationships between different parts of the human bodywhen performing actions and fusion approaches that involve multi-modal sensordata.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>8. <b>标题：Crafting Better Contrastive Views for Siamese Representation Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[51]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03278</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Xiangyu Peng,  Kai Wang,  Zheng Zhu,  Yang You</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：previous works simply apply random sampling, supervised contrastive learning methods greatly benefit, high performance siamese representation learning, could effectively generate better crops, e ., object vs</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Recent self-supervised contrastive learning methods greatly benefit from theSiamese structure that aims at minimizing distances between positive pairs. Forhigh performance Siamese representation learning, one of the keys is to designgood contrastive pairs. Most previous works simply apply random sampling tomake different crops of the same image, which overlooks the semanticinformation that may degrade the quality of views. In this work, we proposeContrastiveCrop, which could effectively generate better crops for Siameserepresentation learning. Firstly, a semantic-aware object localization strategyis proposed within the training process in a fully unsupervised manner. Thisguides us to generate contrastive views which could avoid most false positives(i.e., object vs. background). Moreover, we empirically find that views withsimilar appearances are trivial for the Siamese model training. Thus, acenter-suppressed sampling is further designed to enlarge the variance ofcrops. Remarkably, our method takes a careful consideration of positive pairsfor contrastive learning with negligible extra training overhead. As aplug-and-play and framework-agnostic module, ContrastiveCrop consistentlyimproves SimCLR, MoCo, BYOL, SimSiam by 0.4% ~ 2.0% classification accuracy onCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and STL-10. Superior results are alsoachieved on downstream detection and segmentation tasks when pre-trained onImageNet-1K.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>9. <b>标题：Confidence Guided Depth Completion Network</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[57]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03257</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yongjin Lee,  Seokjun Park,  Beomgu Kang,  Hyunwook Park</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：6 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：proposed model shows much faster computation time, kitti depth completion online leaderboard, estimate accurate dense depth maps, guided depth completion method, first depth map using</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The paper proposes an image-guided depth completion method to estimateaccurate dense depth maps with fast computation time.

Based on the observation that objectboundaries typically align with the boundaries of planar regions, our frameworkachieves semantic segmentation in two steps: planarity-sensibleover-segmentation followed by semantic classification. The over-segmentationstep generates an initial set of mesh segments that capture the planar andnon-planar regions of urban scenes. In the subsequent classification step, weconstruct a graph that encodes geometric and photometric features of thesegments in its nodes and multi-scale contextual features in its edges. Thefinal semantic segmentation is obtained by classifying the segments using agraph convolutional network. Experiments and comparisons on a large semanticurban mesh benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms thestate-of-the-art methods in terms of boundary quality and mean IoU(intersection over union). Besides, we also introduce several new metrics forevaluating mesh over-segmentation methods dedicated for semantic segmentation,and our proposed over-segmentation approach outperforms state-of-the-artmethods on all metrics.

Extensiveefforts have been made recently to develop smart skin-like sensors to extendthe capabilities of biological skins; however, simultaneous sensing of severaltypes of stimuli in a large area remains challenging because this requireslarge-scale sensor integration with numerous wire connections. We propose asimple, highly sensitive, and multimodal sensing approach, which does notrequire integrating multiple sensors. The proposed approach is based on anoptical interference technique, which can encode the information of variousstimuli as a spatial pattern. In contrast to the existing approach, theproposed approach, combined with a deep neural network, enables us to freelyselect the sensing mode according to our purpose. As a key example, wedemonstrate simultaneous sensing mode of three different physical quantities,contact force, contact location, and temperature, using a single soft materialwithout requiring complex integration. Another unique property of the proposedapproach is spatially continuous sensing with ultrahigh resolution of few tensof micrometers, which enables identifying the shape of the object in contact.Furthermore, we present a haptic soft device for a human-machine interface.

Thecorresponding car-following models, which describe how one vehicle followsanother vehicle in the traffic flow, form the cornerstone for microscopictraffic simulation and intelligent vehicle development. One major motivation ofcar-following models is to replicate human drivers' longitudinal drivingtrajectories. To model the long-term dependency of future actions on historicaldriving situations, we developed a long-sequence car-following trajectoryprediction model based on the attention-based Transformer model. The modelfollows a general format of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder takeshistorical speed and spacing data as inputs and forms a mixed representation ofhistorical driving context using multi-head self-attention. The decoder takesthe future LV speed profile as input and outputs the predicted future FV speedprofile in a generative way (instead of an auto-regressive way, avoidingcompounding errors). Through cross-attention between encoder and decoder, thedecoder learns to build a connection between historical driving and future LVspeed, based on which a prediction of future FV speed can be obtained. We trainand test our model with 112,597 real-world car-following events extracted fromthe Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS). Results show that the modeloutperforms the traditional intelligent driver model (IDM), a fully connectedneural network model, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) based model in termsof long-sequence trajectory prediction accuracy.

These non-local operations, which are similar to traditionalpatch-based methods in image processing, complement local convolutions.However, computing the full attention matrix is an expensive step with a heavymemory and computational load. These limitations curb network architectures andperformances, in particular for the case of high resolution images. We proposean efficient attention layer based on the stochastic algorithm PatchMatch,which is used for determining approximate nearest neighbors. We refer to ourproposed layer as a "Patch-based Stochastic Attention Layer" (PSAL).Furthermore, we propose different approaches, based on patch aggregation, toensure the differentiability of PSAL, thus allowing end-to-end training of anynetwork containing our layer. PSAL has a small memory footprint and cantherefore scale to high resolution images. It maintains this footprint withoutsacrificing spatial precision and globality of the nearest neighbours, whichmeans that it can be easily inserted in any level of a deep architecture, evenin shallower levels. We demonstrate the usefulness of PSAL on several imageediting tasks, such as image inpainting and image colorization.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>17. <b>标题：Rate Coding or Direct Coding: Which One is Better for Accurate, Robust,  and Energy-efficient Spiking Neural Networks?</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[108]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03133</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Youngeun Kim,  Hyoungseob Park,  Abhishek Moitra,  Abhiroop Bhattacharjee,  Yeshwanth Venkatesha,  Priyadarshini Panda</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Accepted to ICASSP2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：rate coding also yields higher energy, rate coding shows better robustness, recent spiking neural networks, differentiable spike generation process, achieve better accuracy especially</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Recent Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) works focus on an image classificationtask, therefore various coding techniques have been proposed to convert animage into temporal binary spikes. Among them, rate coding and direct codingare regarded as prospective candidates for building a practical SNN system asthey show state-of-the-art performance on large-scale datasets. Despite theirusage, there is little attention to comparing these two coding schemes in afair manner. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the twocodings from three perspectives: accuracy, adversarial robustness, andenergy-efficiency. First, we compare the performance of two coding techniqueswith various architectures and datasets. Then, we measure the robustness of thecoding techniques on two adversarial attack methods. Finally, we compare theenergy-efficiency of two coding schemes on a digital hardware platform. Ourresults show that direct coding can achieve better accuracy especially for asmall number of timesteps.

Self-supervised monocular depth estimation, a method forpixel-wise distance estimation of objects from a single camera without the useof ground truth labels, is an important task in 3D scene understanding.However, existing methods for this task are limited to convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) architectures. In contrast with CNNs that use localized linearoperations and lose feature resolution across the layers, vision transformersprocess at constant resolution with a global receptive field at every stage.While recent works have compared transformers against their CNN counterpartsfor tasks such as image classification, no study exists that investigates theimpact of using transformers for self-supervised monocular depth estimation.Here, we first demonstrate how to adapt vision transformers for self-supervisedmonocular depth estimation. Thereafter, we compare the transformer andCNN-based architectures for their performance on KITTI depth predictionbenchmarks, as well as their robustness to natural corruptions and adversarialattacks, including when the camera intrinsics are unknown. Our studydemonstrates how transformer-based architecture, though lower in run-timeefficiency, achieves comparable performance while being more robust andgeneralizable.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>19. <b>标题：Reasoning for Complex Data through Ensemble-based Self-Supervised  Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[111]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03126</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Gabriel Bertocco,  Antônio Theófilo,  Fernanda Andaló,  Anderson Rocha</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：On main article: 12 pages, 7 figures and 5 tables On Supplementary material: 5 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：also consider different convolutional neural networks, optimal configuration per dataset, supervised learning methods fail, robust across different modalities, consider two applications</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Self-supervised learning deals with problems that have little or no availablelabeled data. Recent work has shown impressive results when underlying classeshave significant semantic differences. One important dataset in which thistechnique thrives is ImageNet, as intra-class distances are substantially lowerthan inter-class distances. However, this is not the case for several criticaltasks, and general self-supervised learning methods fail to learndiscriminative features when classes have closer semantics, thus requiring morerobust strategies. We propose a strategy to tackle this problem, and to enablelearning from unlabeled data even when samples from different classes are notprominently diverse. We approach the problem by leveraging a novelensemble-based clustering strategy where clusters derived from differentconfigurations are combined to generate a better grouping for the data samplesin a fully-unsupervised way. This strategy allows clusters with differentdensities and higher variability to emerge, which in turn reduces intra-classdiscrepancies, without requiring the burden of finding an optimal configurationper dataset. We also consider different Convolutional Neural Networks tocompute distances between samples. We refine these distances by performingcontext analysis and group them to capture complementary information. Weconsider two applications to validate our pipeline: Person Re-Identificationand Text Authorship Verification. These are challenging applicationsconsidering that classes are semantically close to each other and that trainingand test sets have disjoint identities. Our method is robust across differentmodalities and outperforms state-of-the-art results with a fully-unsupervisedsolution without any labeling or human intervention.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>20. <b>标题：Bubble identification from images with machine learning methods</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[114]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03107</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Hendrik Hessenkemper,  Sebastian Starke,  Yazan Atassi,  Thomas Ziegenhein,  Dirk Lucas</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：testing three different methods based, handle different image conditions, particular difficulty arises due, higher gas volume fractions, created test data sets</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>An automated and reliable processing of bubbly flow images is highly neededto analyse large data sets of comprehensive experimental series.

However,it usually requires training each pairwise combination of tasks together inorder to capture task relationships, at an extremely high computational cost.In this work, we learn task relationships via an automated weighting framework,named Auto-Lambda. Unlike previous methods where task relationships are assumedto be fixed, Auto-Lambda is a gradient-based meta learning framework whichexplores continuous, dynamic task relationships via task-specific weightings,and can optimise any choice of combination of tasks through the formulation ofa meta-loss; where the validation loss automatically influences task weightingsthroughout training. We apply the proposed framework to both multi-task andauxiliary learning problems in computer vision and robotics, and show thatAuto-Lambda achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared tooptimisation strategies designed specifically for each problem and data domain.Finally, we observe that Auto-Lambda can discover interesting learningbehaviors, leading to new insights in multi-task learning.

Most existing re-id methods artificially assume theclothes of every single person to be stationary across space and time. Thiscondition is mostly valid for short-term re-id scenarios since an averageperson would often change the clothes even within a single day. To alleviatethis assumption, several recent works have introduced the clothes change facetto re-id, with a focus on supervised learning person identity discriminativerepresentation with invariance to clothes changes. Taking a step furthertowards this long-term re-id direction, we further eliminate the requirement ofperson identity labels, as they are significantly more expensive and moretedious to annotate in comparison to short-term person re-id datasets. Comparedto conventional unsupervised short-term re-id, this new problem is drasticallymore challenging as different people may have similar clothes whilst the sameperson can wear multiple suites of clothes over different locations and timeswith very distinct appearance. To overcome such obstacles, we introduce a novelCurriculum Person Clustering (CPC) method that can adaptively regulate theunsupervised clustering criterion according to the clustering confidence.Experiments on three long-term person re-id datasets show that our CPCoutperforms SOTA unsupervised re-id methods and even closely matches thesupervised re-id models.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>23. <b>标题：Temporal Point Cloud Completion with Pose Disturbance</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[125]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03084</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Jieqi Shi,  Lingyun Xu,  Peiliang Li,  Xiaozhi Chen,  Shaojie Shen</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：8 pages; Accepted by RAL with ICRA 2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：also use temporal information, provide complete point clouds, point cloud completion framework, refined point cloud, point clouds collected</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Point clouds collected by real-world sensors are always unaligned and sparse,which makes it hard to reconstruct the complete shape of object from a singleframe of data.

Capturing human motion accuratelyfrom a monocular image sequence is still challenging and the modeling qualityis strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of the captured body motion.Our work presents an elegant solution for the integration of temporalconstraints in the fitting process. This does not only increase temporalconsistency but also robustness during the optimization. In detail, we deriveparameters of a sequence of body models, representing shape and motion of aperson, including jaw poses, facial expressions, and finger poses. We optimizethese parameters over the complete image sequence, fitting one consistent bodyshape while imposing temporal consistency on the body motion, assuming linearbody joint trajectories over a short time. Our approach enables the derivationof realistic 3D body models from image sequences, including facial expressionand articulated hands.

Achieved results show that the deep fake unsupervisedsynthesis task has problems in terms of the visual quality of generated data.These problems usually lead to high fake detection accuracy when an expertanalyzes them. The first problem is that existing image-to-image approaches donot consider video domain specificity and frame-by-frame processing leads toface jittering and other clearly visible distortions. Another problem is thegenerated data resolution, which is low for many existing methods due to highcomputational complexity. The third problem appears when the source face haslarger proportions (like bigger cheeks), and after replacement it becomesvisible on the face border.

We randomly partition the image into twosets: visible patches and masked patches. The CAE architecture consists of: (i)an encoder that takes visible patches as input and outputs their latentrepresentations, (ii) a latent context regressor that predicts the masked patchrepresentations from the visible patch representations that are not updated inthis regressor, (iii) a decoder that takes the estimated masked patchrepresentations as input and makes predictions for the masked patches, and (iv)an alignment module that aligns the masked patch representation estimation withthe masked patch representations computed from the encoder.In comparison to previous MIM methods that couple the encoding and decodingroles, e.g., using a single module in BEiT, our approach attemptsto~\emph{separate the encoding role (content understanding) from the decodingrole (making predictions for masked patches)} using different modules,improving the content understanding capability.

Intra-block shuffling increases therobustness of the detector and we also propose an adversarial loss algorithm toovercome the over-fitting problem brought by the noise introduced by shuffling.Moreover, we encourage the detector to focus on finding differences among thelocal features through inter-block shuffling, and reconstruct the spatiallayout of the blocks to model the semantic associations between them.Especially, our method can be easily integrated with various CNN models.Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-artperformance in forgery face detection, including good generalization ability inthe face of common image transformations.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>36. <b>标题：Low-confidence Samples Matter for Domain Adaptation</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[244]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02802</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yixin Zhang,  Junjie Li,  Zilei Wang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：11 pages, 5 figures</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：build reliable pseudo labels, intermediate representations across domains, novel contrastive learning method, way would overlook, instance discrimination process</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich sourcedomain to a related but label-scarce target domain. The conventional DAstrategy is to align the feature distributions of the two domains. Recently,increasing researches have focused on self-training or other semi-supervisedalgorithms to explore the data structure of the target domain. However, thebulk of them depend largely on confident samples in order to build reliablepseudo labels, prototypes or cluster centers. Representing the target datastructure in such a way would overlook the huge low-confidence samples,resulting in sub-optimal transferability that is biased towards the samplessimilar to the source domain. To overcome this issue, we propose a novelcontrastive learning method by processing low-confidence samples, whichencourages the model to make use of the target data structure through theinstance discrimination process. To be specific, we create positive andnegative pairs only using low-confidence samples, and then re-represent theoriginal features with the classifier weights rather than directly utilizingthem, which can better encode the task-specific semantic information.Furthermore, we combine cross-domain mixup to augment the proposed contrastiveloss. Consequently, the domain gap can be well bridged through contrastivelearning of intermediate representations across domains. We evaluate theproposed method in both unsupervised and semi-supervised DA settings, andextensive experimental results on benchmarks reveal that our method iseffective and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

An omnidirectionalimage has a full field-of-view, providing much more complete descriptions ofthe scene than perspective images. However, fully-convolutional networks thatmost current solutions rely on fail to capture rich global contexts from thepanorama. To address this issue and also the distortion of equirectangularprojection in the panorama, we propose Cubemap Vision Transformers (CViT), anew transformer-based architecture that can model long-range dependencies andextract distortion-free global features from the panorama. We show that cubemapvision transformers have a global receptive field at every stage and canprovide globally coherent predictions for spherical signals. To preserveimportant local features, we further design a convolution-based branch in ourpipeline (dubbed GLPanoDepth) and fuse global features from cubemap visiontransformers at multiple scales.

Existing approaches for reducing powerconsumption rely on quite general principles, including avoidance ofmultiplication operations and aggressive quantization of weights andactivations. However, these methods do not take into account the precise powerconsumed by each module in the network, and are therefore not optimal. In thispaper we develop accurate power consumption models for all arithmeticoperations in the DNN, under various working conditions. We reveal severalimportant factors that have been overlooked to date. Based on our analysis, wepresent PANN (power-aware neural network), a simple approach for approximatingany full-precision network by a low-power fixed-precision variant. Our methodcan be applied to a pre-trained network, and can also be used during trainingto achieve improved performance. In contrast to previous methods, PANN incursonly a minor degradation in accuracy w.r.t. the full-precision version of thenetwork, even when working at the power-budget of a 2-bit quantized variant.

When designing an efficient network,trainable layers such as the depthwise convolution is the source of efficiencyin the number of parameters and FLOPs, but there was little improvement to themodel speed in practice. This paper argues that simple built-in parameter-freeoperations can be a favorable alternative to the efficient trainable layersreplacing spatial operations in a network architecture. We aim to break thestereotype of organizing the spatial operations of building blocks intotrainable layers. Extensive experimental analyses based on layer-level studieswith fully-trained models and neural architecture searches are provided toinvestigate whether parameter-free operations such as the max-pool arefunctional. The studies eventually give us a simple yet effective idea forredesigning network architectures, where the parameter-free operations areheavily used as the main building block without sacrificing the model accuracyas much.

The networkis trained as a usual Variational Autoencoder with a negative loglikelihoodloss between training and reconstructed images. The decomposition isnondeterministic, but follows two main schemes, that we may roughly categorizeas either "syntactic" or "semantic". In the first case, the map tends toexploit the strong correlation between adjacent pixels, splitting the image intwo complementary high frequency sub-images. In the second case, the maptypically focuses on the contours of objects, splitting the image ininteresting variations of its content, with more marked and distinctivefeatures. In this case, the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of $\hat{x_1}$and $\hat{x_2}$ is usually lower (hence better) than that of $\hat{x}$, thatclearly suffers from being the average of the formers. In a sense, a SVAEforces the Variational Autoencoder to {\em make choices}, in contrast with itsintrinsic tendency to average between alternatives with the aim to minimize thereconstruction loss towards a specific sample. According to the FID metric, ourtechnique, tested on typical datasets such as Mnist, Cifar10 and Celeba, allowsus to outperform all previous purely variational architectures (not relying onnormalization flows).</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>42. <b>标题：FEAT: Face Editing with Attention</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[272]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02713</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Xianxu Hou,  Linlin Shen,  Or Patashnik,  Daniel Cohen-Or,  Hui Huang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：quantitative experimental results demonstrate, incorporating learned attention maps, face manipulation often intends, explicitly encourages face manipulation, controllable face manipulations based</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Employing the latent space of pretrained generators has recently been shownto be an effective means for GAN-based face manipulation. The success of thisapproach heavily relies on the innate disentanglement of the latent space axesof the generator. However, face manipulation often intends to affect localregions only, while common generators do not tend to have the necessary spatialdisentanglement. In this paper, we build on the StyleGAN generator, and presenta method that explicitly encourages face manipulation to focus on the intendedregions by incorporating learned attention maps. During the generation of theedited image, the attention map serves as a mask that guides a blending betweenthe original features and the modified ones.

However, existing methods paylittle attention to general shapes, which leads to the poor authenticity ofcompletion results. Besides, the missing patterns are diverse in reality, butexisting methods can only handle fixed ones, which means a poor generalizationability. Considering that a partial point cloud is a subset of thecorresponding complete one, we regard them as different samples of the samedistribution and propose Structure Retrieval based Point Completion Network(SRPCN). It first uses k-means clustering to extract structure points anddisperses them into distributions, and then KL Divergence is used as a metricto find the complete structure point cloud that best matches the input in adatabase. Finally, a PCN-like decoder network is adopted to generate the finalresults based on the retrieved structure point clouds.

In this paper, we focus on sparse training and highlight aperhaps counter-intuitive finding, that random pruning at initialization can bequite powerful for the sparse training of modern neural networks. Without anydelicate pruning criteria or carefully pursued sparsity structures, weempirically demonstrate that sparsely training a randomly pruned network fromscratch can match the performance of its dense equivalent. There are two keyfactors that contribute to this revival: (i) the network sizes matter: as theoriginal dense networks grow wider and deeper, the performance of training arandomly pruned sparse network will quickly grow to matching that of its denseequivalent, even at high sparsity ratios; (ii) appropriate layer-wise sparsityratios can be pre-chosen for sparse training, which shows to be anotherimportant performance booster. Simple as it looks, a randomly pruned subnetworkof Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely trained to outperforming a dense WideResNet-50, on ImageNet. We also observed such randomly pruned networksoutperform dense counterparts in other favorable aspects, such asout-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, and adversarialrobustness.

An appropriate solution to adversarialattacks is adversarial training, which reaches a trade-off between robustnessand generalization. This paper introduces a novel framework (LayerSustainability Analysis (LSA)) for the analysis of layer vulnerability in agiven neural network in the scenario of adversarial attacks. LSA can be ahelpful toolkit to assess deep neural networks and to extend the adversarialtraining approaches towards improving the sustainability of model layers vialayer monitoring and analysis. The LSA framework identifies a list of MostVulnerable Layers (MVL list) of a given network. The relative error, as acomparison measure, is used to evaluate representation sustainability of eachlayer against adversarial attack inputs. The proposed approach for obtainingrobust neural networks to fend off adversarial attacks is based on a layer-wiseregularization (LR) over LSA proposal(s) for adversarial training (AT); i.e.the AT-LR procedure. AT-LR could be used with any benchmark adversarial attackto reduce the vulnerability of network layers and to improve conventionaladversarial training approaches. The proposed idea performs well theoreticallyand experimentally for state-of-the-art multilayer perceptron and convolutionalneural network architectures. Compared with the AT-LR and its correspondingbase adversarial training, the classification accuracy of more significantperturbations increased by 16.35%, 21.79%, and 10.730% on Moon, MNIST, andCIFAR-10 benchmark datasets in comparison with the AT-LR and its correspondingbase adversarial training, respectively.

Ideally, a robustclassifier would be immune to small variations in input images, and a number ofdefensive approaches have been created as a result. One method would be todiscern a latent representation which could ignore small changes to the input.However, typical autoencoders easily mingle inter-class latent representationswhen there are strong similarities between classes, making it harder for adecoder to accurately project the image back to the original high-dimensionalspace. We propose a novel framework, Memory Defense, an augmented classifierwith a memory-masking autoencoder to counter this challenge.

Image regions likehideouts, turns, & other obscured regions of the scene also contain crucialinformation, for specific surveillance tasks. Task proposed in this paperinvolves the design of an intelligent visual aid for identification of suchlocations in an image, which has either the potential to create an imminentthreat from an adversary or appear as the target zones needing furtherinvestigation. Covert places (CGL) for hiding behind an occluding object areconcealed 3D locations, not detectable from the viewpoint (camera). Hence thisinvolves delineating specific image regions around the projections of outerboundary of the occluding objects, as places to be accessed around thepotential hideouts. CGL detection finds applications in militarycounter-insurgency operations, surveillance with path planning for anexploratory robot. Given an RGB image, the goal is to identify all CGLs in the2D scene. Identification of such regions would require knowledge about the 3Dboundaries of obscuring items (pillars, furniture), their spatial location withrespect to the neighboring regions of the scene. We propose this as a noveltask, termed Covert Geo-Location (CGL) Detection. Classification of any regionof an image as a CGL (as boundary sub-segments of an occluding object thatconceals the hideout) requires examining the 3D relation between boundaries ofoccluding objects and their neighborhoods & surroundings. Our methodsuccessfully extracts relevant depth features from a single RGB image andquantitatively yields significant improvement over existing object detectionand segmentation models adapted and trained for CGL detection. We alsointroduce a novel hand-annotated CGL detection dataset containing 1.5Kreal-world images for experimentation.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>54. <b>标题：DEVO: Depth-Event Camera Visual Odometry in Challenging Conditions</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[345]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02556</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yi-Fan Zuo,  Jiaqi Yang,  Jiaben Chen,  Xia Wang,  Yifu Wang,  Laurent Kneip</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：accepted in the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Philadelphia (PA), USA</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：computational efficiency towards strong performance, dense visual odometry towards time, time visual odometry framework, proposed method performs comparable, extrinsically calibrated depth camera</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>We present a novel real-time visual odometry framework for a stereo setup ofa depth and high-resolution event camera.

Along this line,unsupervised representation learning is a promising direction to auto-extractfeatures without human intervention. This paper proposes a general unsupervisedapproach, named \textbf{ConClu}, to perform the learning of point-wise andglobal features by jointly leveraging point-level clustering and instance-levelcontrasting. Specifically, for one thing, we design an Expectation-Maximization(EM) like soft clustering algorithm that provides local supervision to extractdiscriminating local features based on optimal transport. We show that thiscriterion extends standard cross-entropy minimization to an optimal transportproblem, which we solve efficiently using a fast variant of the Sinkhorn-Knoppalgorithm. For another, we provide an instance-level contrasting method tolearn the global geometry, which is formulated by maximizing the similaritybetween two augmentations of one point cloud. Experimental evaluations ondownstream applications such as 3D object classification and semanticsegmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and show that itcan outperform state-of-the-art techniques.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>56. <b>标题：PrivPAS: A real time Privacy-Preserving AI System and applied ethics</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[359]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02524</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Harichandana B S S,  Vibhav Agarwal,  Sourav Ghosh,  Gopi Ramena,  Sumit Kumar andd Barath Raj Kandur Raja</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Accepted at 16th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), January 26-28, 2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：human population ), almost 3 billion images, 78 billion social media users worldwide, far received comparatively less attention, unauthorized image captures may also, raise dissent even</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>With 3.78 billion social media users worldwide in 2021 (48% of the humanpopulation), almost 3 billion images are shared daily. At the same time, aconsistent evolution of smartphone cameras has led to a photography explosionwith 85% of all new pictures being captured using smartphones. However, lately,there has been an increased discussion of privacy concerns when a person beingphotographed is unaware of the picture being taken or has reservations aboutthe same being shared. These privacy violations are amplified for people withdisabilities, who may find it challenging to raise dissent even if they areaware. Such unauthorized image captures may also be misused to gain sympathy bythird-party organizations, leading to a privacy breach. Privacy for people withdisabilities has so far received comparatively less attention from the AIcommunity. This motivates us to work towards a solution to generateprivacy-conscious cues for raising awareness in smartphone users of anysensitivity in their viewfinder content. To this end, we introduce PrivPAS (Areal time Privacy-Preserving AI System) a novel framework to identify sensitivecontent. Additionally, we curate and annotate a dataset to identify andlocalize accessibility markers and classify whether an image is sensitive to afeatured subject with a disability. We demonstrate that the proposedlightweight architecture, with a memory footprint of a mere 8.49MB, achieves ahigh mAP of 89.52% on resource-constrained devices.

The perception systemplays a significant role in providing an accurate interpretation of a vehicle'senvironment in real-time. Generally, the perception system involves varioussubsystems such as localization, obstacle (static and dynamic) detection, andavoidance, mapping systems, and others. For perceiving the environment, thesevehicles will be equipped with various exteroceptive (both passive and active)sensors in particular cameras, Radars, LiDARs, and others. These systems areequipped with deep learning techniques that transform the huge amount of datafrom the sensors into semantic information on which the object detection andlocalization tasks are performed. For numerous driving tasks, to provideaccurate results, the location and depth information of a particular object isnecessary. 3D object detection methods, by utilizing the additional pose datafrom the sensors such as LiDARs, stereo cameras, provides information on thesize and location of the object. Based on recent research, 3D object detectionframeworks performing object detection and localization on LiDAR data andsensor fusion techniques show significant improvement in their performance. Inthis work, a comparative study of the effect of using LiDAR data for objectdetection frameworks and the performance improvement seen by using sensorfusion techniques are performed.

The core strength of neural networks is the ability to renderaccurate predictions for a bewildering variety of data.

Despite extensive research in recentyears, FSL is still not yet able to generate satisfactory solutions for a widerange of real-world applications. To confront this challenge, we study the FSLproblem from a geometric point of view in this paper. One observation is thatthe widely embraced ProtoNet model is essentially a Voronoi Diagram (VD) in thefeature space. We retrofit it by making use of a recent advance incomputational geometry called Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD). Startingfrom the simplest nearest neighbor model, CIVD gradually incorporatescluster-to-point and then cluster-to-cluster relationships for spacesubdivision, which is used to improve the accuracy and robustness at multiplestages of FSL. Specifically, we use CIVD (1) to integrate parametric andnonparametric few-shot classifiers; (2) to combine feature representation andsurrogate representation; (3) and to leverage feature-level,transformation-level, and geometry-level heterogeneities for a better ensemble.Our CIVD-based workflow enables us to achieve new state-of-the-art results onmini-ImageNet, CUB, and tiered-ImagenNet datasets, with ${\sim}2\%{-}5\%$improvements upon the next best. To summarize, CIVD provides a mathematicallyelegant and geometrically interpretable framework that compensates for extremedata insufficiency, prevents overfitting, and allows for fast geometricensemble for thousands of individual VD. These together make FSL stronger.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>62. <b>标题：Spelunking the Deep: Guaranteed Queries for General Neural Implicit  Surfaces</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[399]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02444</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Nicholas Sharp,  Alec Jacobson</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：develop geometric queries including ray casting, offer concrete accuracy guarantees even, best evaluate geometric queries, using automatic arithmetic rules, general neural implicit functions</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Neural implicit representations, which encode a surface as the level set of aneural network applied to spatial coordinates, have proven to be remarkablyeffective for optimizing, compressing, and generating 3D geometry. Althoughthese representations are easy to fit, it is not clear how to best evaluategeometric queries on the shape, such as intersecting against a ray or finding aclosest point. The predominant approach is to encourage the network to have asigned distance property. However, this property typically holds onlyapproximately, leading to robustness issues, and holds only at the conclusionof training, inhibiting the use of queries in loss functions. Instead, thiswork presents a new approach to perform queries directly on general neuralimplicit functions for a wide range of existing architectures. Our key tool isthe application of range analysis to neural networks, using automaticarithmetic rules to bound the output of a network over a region; we conduct astudy of range analysis on neural networks, and identify variants of affinearithmetic which are highly effective. We use the resulting bounds to developgeometric queries including ray casting, intersection testing, constructingspatial hierarchies, fast mesh extraction, closest-point evaluation, evaluatingbulk properties, and more. Our queries can be efficiently evaluated on GPUs,and offer concrete accuracy guarantees even on randomly-initialized networks,enabling their use in training objectives and beyond.

The distortions that inevitably occurwhen mapping spherical data onto the 2D image plane, however, impair theperformance of classical inter prediction techniques. In this paper, we proposea motion-plane-adaptive inter prediction technique (MPA) for 360-degree videothat takes the spherical characteristics of 360-degree video into account.Based on the known projection format of the video, MPA allows to perform interprediction on different motion planes in 3D space instead of having to work onthe - in theory arbitrarily mapped - 2D image representation directly. Wefurthermore derive a motion-plane-adaptive motion vector prediction technique(MPA-MVP) that allows to translate motion information between different motionplanes and motion models.

To our best acknowledge, however, most methods evaluated theirperformance with no-reference way using few selected real-world images frominternet. It is unclear how to quantitatively analysis the performance of thealgorithms in a supervised way and how we could gauge the progress in thefield. Moreover, due to the absence of large-scale benchmark datasets, thereare no well-known reports of data-driven based method for sand dust imageenhancement up till now. To advance the development of deep learning-basedalgorithms for sand dust image reconstruction, while enabling supervisedobjective evaluation of algorithm performance. In this paper, we presented acomprehensive perceptual study and analysis of real-world sand dust images,then constructed a Sand-dust Image Reconstruction Benchmark (SIRB) for trainingConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and evaluating algorithms performance. Inaddition, we adopted the existing image transformation neural network trainedon SIRB as baseline to illustrate the generalization of SIRB for training CNNs.Finally, we conducted the qualitative and quantitative evaluation todemonstrate the performance and limitations of the state-of-the-arts (SOTA),which shed light on future research in sand dust image reconstruction.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>71. <b>标题：SUD: Supervision by Denoising for Medical Image Segmentation</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[485]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02952</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Sean I.

For many segmentation problems, however,data with pixel- or voxel-level labeling accuracy are scarce due to the cost ofmanual labeling. This problem is exacerbated in domains where manual annotationis difficult, resulting in large amounts of variability in the labeling evenacross domain experts. Therefore, training segmentation networks to generalizebetter by learning from both labeled and unlabeled images (calledsemi-supervised learning) is problem of both practical and theoreticalinterest. However, traditional semi-supervised learning methods forsegmentation often necessitate hand-crafting a differentiable regularizerspecific to a given segmentation problem, which can be extremelytime-consuming. In this work, we propose "supervision by denoising" (SUD), aframework that enables us to supervise segmentation models using their denoisedoutput as targets. SUD unifies temporal ensembling and spatial denoisingtechniques under a spatio-temporal denoising framework and alternates denoisingand network weight update in an optimization framework for semi-supervision. Wevalidate SUD on three tasks-kidney and tumor (3D), and brain (3D) segmentation,and cortical parcellation (2D)-demonstrating a significant improvement in theDice overlap and the Hausdorff distance of segmentations over supervised-onlyand temporal ensemble baselines.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>72. <b>标题：Deep Deterministic Independent Component Analysis for Hyperspectral  Unmixing</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[486]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02951</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Hongming Li,  Shujian Yu,  Jose C.

To address this issue, we propose the first coding frameworkfor compressed video understanding, where another learnable perceptualbitstream is introduced and simultaneously transported with the videobitstream. With the sophisticatedly designed optimization target and networkarchitectures, this new stream largely boosts the perceptual quality of thedecoded videos yet with a small bit cost.

Although slide digitization via whole slide imaging scanners hasincreased the speed of data acquisition, labeling of virtual slides requires asubstantial time investment from pathologists. Eye gaze annotations have thepotential to speed up the slide labeling process. This work explores theviability and timing comparisons of eye gaze labeling compared to conventionalmanual labeling for training object detectors. Challenges associated with gazebased labeling and methods to refine the coarse data annotations for subsequentobject detection are also discussed.

The key building block of a CNN is theconvolutional kernel that aggregates information from the pixel neighborhoodand shares weights across all pixels. A standard CNN's capacity, and thus itsperformance, is directly related to the number of learnable kernel weights,which is determined by the number of channels and the kernel size (support). Inthis paper, we present the \textit{hyper-convolution}, a novel building blockthat implicitly encodes the convolutional kernel using spatial coordinates.Hyper-convolutions decouple kernel size from the total number of learnableparameters, enabling a more flexible architecture design.

Indeed,postprocessing analysis workflows on simulation data often generate a largenumber of images from the raw data, many of which are then compared to eachother or to specified reference images. In this image-comparison scenario,image quality assessment (IQA) measures are quite useful, and the StructuralSimilarity Index (SSIM) continues to be a popular choice. However, generatinglarge numbers of images can be costly, and plot-specific (but data independent)choices can affect the SSIM value. A natural question is whether we can applythe SSIM directly to the floating-point simulation data and obtain anindication of whether differences in the data are likely to impact a visualassessment, effectively bypassing the creation of a specific set of images fromthe data. To this end, we propose an alternative to the popular SSIM that canbe applied directly to the floating point data, which we refer to as the DataSSIM (DSSIM). While we demonstrate the usefulness of the DSSIM in the contextof evaluating differences due to lossy compression on large volumes ofsimulation data from a popular climate model, the DSSIM may prove useful formany other applications involving simulation or image data.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>80. <b>标题：ROMNet: Renovate the Old Memories</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[520]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02606</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Runsheng Xu,  Zhengzhong Tu,  Yuanqi Du,  Xiaoyu Dong,  Jinlong Li,  Zibo Meng,  Jiaqi Ma,  Hongkai YU</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Submitted to TIP</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：scale paired old photo datasets makes, evaluating old photo restoration models, whole system takes advantage, world old photo dataset, manually restored pristine image</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Renovating the memories in old photos is an intriguing research topic incomputer vision fields. These legacy images often suffer from severe andcommingled degradations such as cracks, noise, and color-fading, while lack oflarge-scale paired old photo datasets makes this restoration task verychallenging. In this work, we present a novel reference-based end-to-endlearning framework that can jointly repair and colorize the degraded legacypictures. Specifically, the proposed framework consists of three modules: arestoration sub-network for degradation restoration, a similarity sub-networkfor color histogram matching and transfer, and a colorization subnet thatlearns to predict the chroma elements of the images conditioned on chromaticreference signals. The whole system takes advantage of the color histogrampriors in a given reference image, which vastly reduces the dependency onlarge-scale training data.

The mainstream DL methodology for the MI-EEG classification exploits thetemporospatial patterns of EEG signals using convolutional neural networks(CNNs), which have been particularly successful in visual images. However,since the statistical characteristics of visual images may not benefit EEGsignals, a natural question that arises is whether there exists an alternativenetwork architecture despite CNNs to extract features for the MI-EEGclassification. To address this question, we propose a novel geometric deeplearning (GDL) framework called Tensor-CSPNet to characterize EEG signals onsymmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and exploit thetemporo-spatio-frequential patterns using deep neural networks on SPDmanifolds. Meanwhile, many experiences of successful MI-EEG classifiers havebeen integrated into the Tensor-CSPNet framework to make it more efficient. Inthe experiments, Tensor-CSPNet attains or slightly outperforms the currentstate-of-the-art performance on the cross-validation and holdout scenarios oftwo MI-EEG datasets. The visualization and interpretability analyses alsoexhibit its validity for the MI-EEG classification. To conclude, we provide afeasible answer to the question by generalizing the previous DL methodologieson SPD manifolds, which indicates the start of a specific class from the GDLmethodology for the MI-EEG classification.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>82. <b>标题：Machine Learning Method for Functional Assessment of Retinal Models</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[530]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02443</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Nikolas Papadopoulos,  Nikos Melanitis,  Antonio Lozano,  Cristina Soto-Sanchez,  Eduardo Fernandez,  Konstantina S Nikita</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Accepted at 2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：accurately simulate retinal ganglion cells, feed traditional machine learning classifiers, accurately predict rgc response, optimally feed rgc responses, examined critical fa aspects</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Challenges in the field of retinal prostheses motivate the development ofretinal models to accurately simulate Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs) responses.The goal of retinal prostheses is to enable blind individuals to solve complex,reallife visual tasks. In this paper, we introduce the functional assessment(FA) of retinal models, which describes the concept of evaluating theperformance of retinal models on visual understanding tasks. We present amachine learning method for FA: we feed traditional machine learningclassifiers with RGC responses generated by retinal models, to solve object anddigit recognition tasks (CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Imagenette). Weexamined critical FA aspects, including how the performance of FA depends onthe task, how to optimally feed RGC responses to the classifiers and how thenumber of output neurons correlates with the model's accuracy. To increase thenumber of output neurons, we manipulated input images - by splitting and thenfeeding them to the retinal model and we found that image splitting does notsignificantly improve the model's accuracy. We also show that differences inthe structure of datasets result in largely divergent performance of theretinal model (MNIST and Fashion MNIST exceeded 80% accuracy, while CIFAR-10and Imagenette achieved ~40%). Furthermore, retinal models which perform betterin standard evaluation, i.e. more accurately predict RGC response, performbetter in FA as well. However, unlike standard evaluation, FA results can bestraightforwardly interpreted in the context of comparing the quality of visualperception.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>83. <b>标题：Stratification of carotid atheromatous plaque using interpretable deep  learning methods on B-mode ultrasound images</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[532]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02428</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Theofanis Ganitidis,  Maria Athanasiou,  Kalliopi Dalakleidi,  Nikos Melanitis,  Spyretta Golemati,  Konstantina S Nikita</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Accepted at 2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：proposed approach achieved acceptable discrimination performance, auc ): 73 %, sensitivity, two fully connected layers, novel ultrasound image biomarkers, ensemble learning scheme based</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Carotid atherosclerosis is the major cause of ischemic stroke resulting insignificant rates of mortality and disability annually.

This paper introduces an interpretableclassification approach of carotid ultrasound images for the risk assessmentand stratification of patients with carotid atheromatous plaque. To address thehighly imbalanced distribution of patients between the symptomatic andasymptomatic classes (16 vs 58, respectively), an ensemble learning schemebased on a sub-sampling approach was applied along with a two-phase,cost-sensitive strategy of learning, that uses the original and a resampleddata set. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were utilized for building theprimary models of the ensemble. A six-layer deep CNN was used to automaticallyextract features from the images, followed by a classification stage of twofully connected layers.

Wevalidated the usefulness of our extraction method by using it to achievestate-of-the-art results in retinal artery-vein classification.Our proposed approach works as follows. We first segment the retinal vesselsusing our previously developed state-of-the-art segmentation method. Then, weestimate an initial graph from the extracted vessels and assign the most likelyblood flow to each edge. We then use a handful of high-level operations (HLOs)to fix errors in the graph. These HLOs include detaching neighboring nodes,shifting the endpoints of an edge, and reversing the estimated blood flowdirection for a branch. We use a novel cost function to find the optimal set ofHLO operations for a given graph. Finally, we show that our extracted vascularstructure is correct by propagating artery/vein labels along the branches. Asour experiments show, our topology-based artery-vein labeling achievedstate-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

We combine the strengths of triple copy strategy DST and valuematching to benefit from complementary predictions without violating theprinciple of ontology independence. Our experiments demonstrate that anextractive DST model can be trained without manual span labels. Ourarchitecture and training strategies improve robustness towards samplesparsity, new concepts and topics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on arange of benchmarks.

In this paper, we undertake a thoroughanalysis towards better visualising and understanding the factors thatcharacterise and differentiate social media users affected by mental disorders.We perform different experiments studying multiple dimensions of language,including vocabulary uniqueness, word usage, linguistic style, psychometricattributes, emotions' co-occurrence patterns, and online behavioural traits,including social engagement and posting trends. Our findings reveal significantdifferences on the use of function words, such as adverbs and verb tense, andtopic-specific vocabulary, such as biological processes. As for emotionalexpression, we observe that affected users tend to share emotions moreregularly than control individuals on average. Overall, the monthly postingvariance of the affected groups is higher than the control groups. Moreover, wefound evidence suggesting that language use on micro-blogging platforms is lessdistinguishable for users who have a mental disorder than other lessrestrictive platforms. In particular, we observe on Twitter less quantifiabledifferences between affected and control groups compared to Reddit.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>4. <b>标题：Red Teaming Language Models with Language Models</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[47]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03286</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Ethan Perez,  Saffron Huang,  Francis Song,  Trevor Cai,  Roman Ring,  John Aslanides,  Amelia Glaese,  Nat McAleese,  Geoffrey Irving</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：generating test cases (" red teaming ") using another lm, prior work identifies harmful behaviors, generated test questions using, based red teaming, hospital phone numbers generated</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Language Models (LMs) often cannot be deployed because of their potential toharm users in hard-to-predict ways. Prior work identifies harmful behaviorsbefore deployment by using human annotators to hand-write test cases. However,human annotation is expensive, limiting the number and diversity of test cases.In this work, we automatically find cases where a target LM behaves in aharmful way, by generating test cases ("red teaming") using another LM. Weevaluate the target LM's replies to generated test questions using a classifiertrained to detect offensive content, uncovering tens of thousands of offensivereplies in a 280B parameter LM chatbot. We explore several methods, fromzero-shot generation to reinforcement learning, for generating test cases withvarying levels of diversity and difficulty. Furthermore, we use promptengineering to control LM-generated test cases to uncover a variety of otherharms, automatically finding groups of people that the chatbot discusses inoffensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot'sown contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harmsthat occur over the course of a conversation. Overall, LM-based red teaming isone promising tool (among many needed) for finding and fixing diverse,undesirable LM behaviors before impacting users.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>5. <b>标题：Efficient Adapter Transfer of Self-Supervised Speech Models for  Automatic Speech Recognition</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[71]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03218</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Bethan Thomas,  Samuel Kessler,  Salah Karout</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：5 Pages, 4 figures.

Transformer based models suchas wav2vec 2.0 and HuBERT are leading the field in the speech domain. Generallythese models are fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data for a downstreamtask such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). This involves re-training themajority of the model for each task. Adapters are small lightweight moduleswhich are commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to adaptpre-trained models to new tasks. In this paper we propose applying adapters towav2vec 2.0 to reduce the number of parameters required for downstream ASRtasks, and increase scalability of the model to multiple tasks or languages.Using adapters we can perform ASR while training fewer than 10% of parametersper task compared to full fine-tuning with little degradation of performance.Ablations show that applying adapters into just the top few layers of thepre-trained network gives similar performance to full transfer, supporting thetheory that higher pre-trained layers encode more phonemic information, andfurther optimizing efficiency.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>6. <b>标题：Conversational Agents: Theory and Applications</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[96]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03164</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Mattias Wahde,  Marco Virgolin</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：preprint of a chapter to appear in Handbook of Computer Learning and Intelligence - Volume 1</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：cas ), discussing chatbots, potential risks regarding, many different approaches, future ca technology, briefly reviewing aspects</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>In this chapter, we provide a review of conversational agents (CAs),discussing chatbots, intended for casual conversation with a user, as well astask-oriented agents that generally engage in discussions intended to reach oneor several specific goals, often (but not always) within a specific domain.

The first challengemeans that arguments of one event record could reside in different sentences inthe document, while the second one reflects one document may simultaneouslycontain multiple such event records. Motivated by humans' reading cognitive toextract information of interests, in this paper, we propose a method called HRE(Human Reading inspired Extractor for Document Events), where DEE is decomposedinto these two iterative stages, rough reading and elaborate reading.Specifically, the first stage browses the document to detect the occurrence ofevents, and the second stage serves to extract specific event arguments. Foreach concrete event role, elaborate reading hierarchically works from sentencesto characters to locate arguments across sentences, thus thescattering-arguments problem is tackled.

As the domain is becomingincreasingly popular - the majority of scientific papers on the topic of signlanguage translation have been published in the past three years - we providean overview of the state of the art as well as some required background in thedifferent related disciplines. We give a high-level introduction to signlanguage linguistics and machine translation to illustrate the requirements ofautomatic sign language translation. We present a systematic literature reviewto illustrate the state of the art in the domain and then, harking back to therequirements, lay out several challenges for future research. We find thatsignificant advances have been made on the shoulders of spoken language machinetranslation research. However, current approaches are often not linguisticallymotivated or are not adapted to the different input modality of sign languages.We explore challenges related to the representation of sign language data, thecollection of datasets, the need for interdisciplinary research andrequirements for moving beyond research, towards applications. Based on ourfindings, we advocate for interdisciplinary research and to base futureresearch on linguistic analysis of sign languages.

To answer this question, we propose a novel training strategythat encourages all parameters to be trained sufficiently.

A parameter with low sensitivity isredundant, and we improve its fitting by increasing its learning rate.

The advent of advanced language models such asOpenAI's GPT-series offers new possibilities for addressing this problem. Thispaper presents a mechanism to harness the narrative output of large languagemodels and produce diagrams or "maps" of the relationships that are latent inthe weights of such models as the GPT-3. The resulting "Neural Narrative Maps"(NNMs), are intended to provide insight into the organization of information,opinion, and belief in the model, which in turn provide means to understandintent and response in the context of physical distance. This paper discussesthe problem of mapping information spaces in general, and then presents aconcrete implementation of this concept in the context of OpenAI's GPT-3language model for determining if a subordinate is following a commander'sintent in a high-risk situation. The subordinate's locations within the NNMallow a novel capability to evaluate the intent of the subordinate with respectto the commander. We show that is is possible not only to determine if they arenearby in narrative space, but also how they are oriented, and what"trajectory" they are on.

In this work,we propose a modular approach that sequentially carries out binaryclassification for every prediction subtask as in the SciFact leaderboard. Oursimple classifier-based approach uses reduced abstract representations toretrieve relevant abstracts. These are further used to train the relevantrationale-selection model. Finally, we carry out two-step stance predictionsthat first differentiate non-relevant rationales and then identify supportingor refuting rationales for a given claim. Experimentally, our system RerrFactwith no fine-tuning, simple design, and a fraction of model parameters fairscompetitively on the leaderboard against large-scale, modular, and jointmodeling approaches.

In order to obtain a near-optimal model for the given downstreamtask, a search in optimization hyperparameter space is usually required. Inparticular, the number of training epochs needs to be adjusted to the datasetsize. In this paper, we introduce adaptive fine-tuning, which is an alternativeapproach that uses early stopping and a custom learning rate schedule todynamically adjust the number of training epochs to the dataset size. For theexample use case of named entity recognition, we show that our approach notonly makes hyperparameter search with respect to the number of training epochsredundant, but also leads to improved results in terms of performance,stability and efficiency.

Manystate-of-the-art self-training approaches hinge on different regularizationmethods to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. Yet they still relyheavily on predictions initially trained with the limited labeled data aspseudo-labels and are likely to put overconfident label belief on erroneousclasses depending on the first prediction.

The discrete-time speech signal is split intofrequency sub-bands via a multi-level discrete wavelet transform. Various gainsare applied to the sub-band signals before they are recombined to form amodified version of the speech. The sub-band gains are adjusted while keepingthe overall signal energy unchanged, and the speech intelligibility undervarious background interference and simulated hearing loss conditions isenhanced and evaluated objectively and quantitatively using GoogleSpeech-to-Text transcription. For English and Chinese noise-free speech,overall intelligibility is improved, and the transcription accuracy can beincreased by as much as 80 percentage points by reallocating the spectralenergy toward the mid-frequency sub-bands, effectively increasing theconsonant-vowel intensity ratio. This is reasonable since the consonants arerelatively weak and of short duration, which are therefore the most likely tobecome indistinguishable in the presence of background noise or high-frequencyhearing impairment. For speech already corrupted by noise, improvingintelligibility is challenging but still realizable. The proposed algorithm isimplementable for real-time signal processing and comparatively simpler thanprevious algorithms. Potential applications include speech enhancement, hearingaids, machine listening, and a better understanding of speech intelligibility.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>28. <b>标题：Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis through EDU-level Attentions</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[354]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02535</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Ting Lin,  Aixin Sun,  Yequan Wang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Accepted in PAKDD2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：three benchmark datasets show, manual edu boundary annotation, sentence may express sentiments, attention model outperforms state, often adversely affected</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>A sentence may express sentiments on multiple aspects. When these aspects areassociated with different sentiment polarities, a model's accuracy is oftenadversely affected. We observe that multiple aspects in such hard sentences aremostly expressed through multiple clauses, or formally known as elementarydiscourse units (EDUs), and one EDU tends to express a single aspect withunitary sentiment towards that aspect. In this paper, we propose to considerEDU boundaries in sentence modeling, with attentions at both word and EDUlevels. Specifically, we highlight sentiment-bearing words in EDU throughword-level sparse attention. Then at EDU level, we force the model to attend tothe right EDU for the right aspect, by using EDU-level sparse attention andorthogonal regularization. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show thatour simple EDU-Attention model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. BecauseEDU can be automatically segmented with high accuracy, our model can be appliedto sentences directly without the need of manual EDU boundary annotation.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>29. <b>标题：LEAPMood: Light and Efficient Architecture to Predict Mood with Genetic  Algorithm driven Hyperparameter Tuning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[360]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02522</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Harichandana B S S,  Sumit Kumar</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Accepted at 16th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing (ICSC), January 26-28, 2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：model size (> 90 %), use cases like user profiling, one primary source indicative, device deep learning approach, first building block followed</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Accurate and automatic detection of mood serves as a building block for usecases like user profiling which in turn power applications such as advertising,recommendation systems, and many more. One primary source indicative of anindividual's mood is textual data. While there has been extensive research onemotion recognition, the field of mood prediction has been barely explored. Inaddition, very little work is done in the area of on-device inferencing, whichis highly important from the user privacy point of view. In this paper, wepropose for the first time, an on-device deep learning approach for moodprediction from textual data, LEAPMood. We use a novel on-devicedeployment-focused objective function for hyperparameter tuning based on theGenetic Algorithm (GA) and optimize the parameters concerning both performanceand size. LEAPMood consists of Emotion Recognition in Conversion (ERC) as thefirst building block followed by mood prediction using K-means clustering.

To alleviate the problem, thecombination of the traditional statistical method and deep learning model aswell as a novel model based on multi model nonlinear fusion are proposed inthis paper. The model uses the Jaccard coefficient based on part of speech,Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) and word2vec-CNN algorithmto measure the similarity of sentences respectively. According to thecalculation accuracy of each model, the normalized weight coefficient isobtained and the calculation results are compared.

The main idea behind currentapproaches to solving letter-string analogies is to design heuristic rules forextracting analogy structures and constructing analogy mappings. However, onekey problem is that it is difficult to build a comprehensive and exhaustive setof analogy structures which can fully describe the subtlety of analogies. Thisproblem makes current approaches unable to handle complicated letter-stringanalogy problems. In this paper, we propose Neural logic analogy learning(Noan), which is a dynamic neural architecture driven by differentiable logicreasoning to solve analogy problems. Each analogy problem is converted intological expressions consisting of logical variables and basic logicaloperations (AND, OR, and NOT). More specifically, Noan learns the logicalvariables as vector embeddings and learns each logical operation as a neuralmodule. In this way, the model builds computational graph integrating neuralnetwork with logical reasoning to capture the internal logical structure of theinput letter strings. The analogy learning problem then becomes a True/Falseevaluation problem of the logical expressions. Experiments show that ourmachine learning-based Noan approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches onstandard letter-string analogy benchmark datasets.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>34. <b>标题：Transformers and the representation of biomedical background knowledge</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[406]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02432</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Oskar Wysocki (1,2),  Zili Zhou (1,2),  Paul O'Regan (2),  Deborah Ferreira (1),  Magdalena Wysocka (2),  Dónal Landers (2),  André Freitas (1,2,3) ((1) Department of Computer Science, The University of Manchester, (2) digital Experimental Cancer Medicine Team, Cancer Biomarker Centre, CRUK Manchester Institute, University of Manchester, (3) Idiap Research Institute)</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：22 pages, 12 figures, supplementary methods, tables and figures at the end of the manuscript</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：publicly available biomedical corpora, indeed encode biological knowledge, biomedical domain based, scale biological knowledge, different transformer baselines</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>BioBERT and BioMegatron are Transformers models adapted for the biomedicaldomain based on publicly available biomedical corpora.

The design of effectivemeasurement operators is typically constrained by the underlying hardware andphysics, posing a challenging and often even discrete optimization task. Whilethe potential of gradient-based learning via the unrolling of iterativerecovery algorithms has been demonstrated, it has remained unclear how toleverage this technique when the set of admissible measurement operators isstructured and discrete. We tackle this problem by combining unrolledoptimization with Gumbel reparametrizations, which enable the computation oflow-variance gradient estimates of categorical random variables. Our approachis formalized by GLODISMO (Gradient-based Learning of DIscrete StructuredMeasurement Operators). This novel method is easy-to-implement, computationallyefficient, and extendable due to its compatibility with automaticdifferentiation.

Despite the decent performance,existing text-video retrieval models in vision and language communities areimpractical for large-scale Web search because they adopt brute-force searchbased on high-dimensional embeddings. To improve efficiency, Web search engineswidely apply vector compression libraries (e.g., FAISS) to post-process thelearned embeddings. Unfortunately, separate compression from feature encodingdegrades the robustness of representations and incurs performance decay. Topursue a better balance between performance and efficiency, we propose thefirst quantized representation learning method for cross-view video retrieval,namely Hybrid Contrastive Quantization (HCQ). Specifically, HCQ learns bothcoarse-grained and fine-grained quantizations with transformers, which providecomplementary understandings for texts and videos and preserve comprehensivesemantic information. By performing Asymmetric-Quantized Contrastive Learning(AQ-CL) across views, HCQ aligns texts and videos at coarse-grained andmultiple fine-grained levels. This hybrid-grained learning strategy serves asstrong supervision on the cross-view video quantization model, wherecontrastive learning at different levels can be mutually promoted. Extensiveexperiments on three Web video benchmark datasets demonstrate that HCQ achievescompetitive performance with state-of-the-art non-compressed retrieval methodswhile showing high efficiency in storage and computation.

CIM uses an auxiliary generator with a small trainable BEiT tocorrupt the input image instead of using artificial mask tokens, where somepatches are randomly selected and replaced with plausible alternatives sampledfrom the BEiT output distribution. Given this corrupted image, an enhancernetwork learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predictwhether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. Thegenerator and the enhancer are simultaneously trained and synergisticallyupdated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visualencoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-trainingframework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the firsttime, CIM demonstrates that both ViT and CNN can learn rich visualrepresentations using a unified, non-Siamese framework. Experimental resultsshow that our approach achieves compelling results in vision benchmarks, suchas ImageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation.

Theconstructed set of generators captures polynomial structures in data and givesrise to a feature map that can, for example, be used in combination with alinear classifier for supervised learning. In CGAVI, we construct the set ofgenerators by solving specific instances of (constrained) convex optimizationproblems with the Pairwise Frank-Wolfe algorithm (PFW).

In some regimes, theypredict that the method has a `spectral bias': decomposing the true function$f^*$ on the eigenbasis of the kernel, it fits well the coefficients associatedwith the O(P) largest eigenvalues, where $P$ is the size of the training set.This prediction works very well on benchmark data sets such as images, yet theassumptions these approaches make on the data are never satisfied in practice.To clarify when the spectral bias prediction holds, we first focus on aone-dimensional model where rigorous results are obtained and then use scalingarguments to generalize and test our findings in higher dimensions.

Such issues arise from the overfitting issue, which we discover fromour own analysis and the previous studies to originate from the frequency-levelartifacts in generated images. We find that ignoring the frequency-levelartifacts can improve the detector's generalization across various GAN models,but it can reduce the model's performance for the trained GAN models. Thus, wedesign a framework to generalize the deepfake detector for both the known andunseen GAN models. Our framework generates the frequency-level perturbationmaps to make the generated images indistinguishable from the real images. Byupdating the deepfake detector along with the training of the perturbationgenerator, our model is trained to detect the frequency-level artifacts at theinitial iterations and consider the image-level irregularities at the lastiterations.

Most existing research focuses primarily onbalancing the sparsity and accuracy of a pruned neural network by strategicallyremoving insignificant parameters and retraining the pruned model. Such effortson reusing training samples pose serious privacy risks due to increasedmemorization, which, however, has not been investigated yet.In this paper, we conduct the first analysis of privacy risks in neuralnetwork pruning. Specifically, we investigate the impacts of neural networkpruning on training data privacy, i.e., membership inference attacks. We firstexplore the impact of neural network pruning on prediction divergence, wherethe pruning process disproportionately affects the pruned model's behavior formembers and non-members. Meanwhile, the influence of divergence even variesamong different classes in a fine-grained manner. Enlighten by such divergence,we proposed a self-attention membership inference attack against the prunedneural networks. Extensive experiments are conducted to rigorously evaluate theprivacy impacts of different pruning approaches, sparsity levels, and adversaryknowledge. The proposed attack shows the higher attack performance on thepruned models when compared with eight existing membership inference attacks.In addition, we propose a new defense mechanism to protect the pruning processby mitigating the prediction divergence based on KL-divergence distance, whoseeffectiveness has been experimentally demonstrated to effectively mitigate theprivacy risks while maintaining the sparsity and accuracy of the pruned models.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>18. <b>标题：Policy Optimization for Stochastic Shortest Path</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[31]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03334</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Liyu Chen,  Haipeng Luo,  Aviv Rosenberg</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：luo et al ., 2021 )., one key technical contribution, better captures many applications, successful reinforcement learning algorithms, oriented reinforcement learning model</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Policy optimization is among the most popular and successful reinforcementlearning algorithms, and there is increasing interest in understanding itstheoretical guarantees.

Suchsampling is computationally challenging in high-dimensional problems andtheoretical results on heuristic uncertainty estimators in high-dimensions arethus scarce. In this manuscript, we characterise uncertainty for learning fromlimited number of samples of high-dimensional Gaussian input data and labelsgenerated by the probit model. We prove that the Bayesian uncertainty (i.e. theposterior marginals) can be asymptotically obtained by the approximate messagepassing algorithm, bypassing the canonical but costly Monte Carlo sampling ofthe posterior. We then provide a closed-form formula for the joint statisticsbetween the logistic classifier, the uncertainty of the statistically optimalBayesian classifier and the ground-truth probit uncertainty. The formula allowsus to investigate calibration of the logistic classifier learning from limitedamount of samples. We discuss how over-confidence can be mitigated byappropriately regularising, and show that cross-validating with respect to theloss leads to better calibration than with the 0/1 error.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>21. <b>标题：Approximation error of single hidden layer neural networks with fixed  weights</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[45]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03289</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Vugar Ismailov</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2005.14125</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：single hidden layer neural networks, two fixed weights, paper provides, explicit formula, approximation error</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>This paper provides an explicit formula for the approximation error of singlehidden layer neural networks with two fixed weights.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>22. <b>标题：Gaussian Graphical Models as an Ensemble Method for Distributed Gaussian  Processes</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[46]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03287</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Hamed Jalali,  Gjergji Kasneci</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：OPT2021: 13th Annual Workshop on Optimization for Machine Learning</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：generally yields poor results, new method outperforms, experimental evaluations illustrate, conditional independence assumption, acquire global prediction</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Distributed Gaussian process (DGP) is a popular approach to scale GP to bigdata which divides the training data into some subsets, performs localinference for each partition, and aggregates the results to acquire globalprediction. To combine the local predictions, the conditional independenceassumption is used which basically means there is a perfect diversity betweenthe subsets. Although it keeps the aggregation tractable, it is often violatedin practice and generally yields poor results. In this paper, we propose anovel approach for aggregating the Gaussian experts' predictions by Gaussiangraphical model (GGM) where the target aggregation is defined as an unobservedlatent variable and the local predictions are the observed variables. We firstestimate the joint distribution of latent and observed variables using theExpectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The interaction between experts can beencoded by the precision matrix of the joint distribution and the aggregatedpredictions are obtained based on the property of conditional Gaussiandistribution.

Furthermore, we use promptengineering to control LM-generated test cases to uncover a variety of otherharms, automatically finding groups of people that the chatbot discusses inoffensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot'sown contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harmsthat occur over the course of a conversation.

Traditional causal effect estimation methods suchas Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recentlyRegression-With-Residuals (RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challengingtask of identifying the SCM parameters - to estimate ATE and CATE. However,much work remains before traditional estimation methods can be used forcounterfactual inference, and for the benefit of Personalized Public PolicyAnalysis (P$^3$A) in the social sciences. While doctors rely on personalizedmedicine to tailor treatments to patients in laboratory settings (relativelyclosed systems), P$^3$A draws inspiration from such tailoring but adapts it foropen social systems. In this article, we develop a method for counterfactualinference that we name causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF), facilitatingP$^3$A. First, we show how c-GNF captures the underlying SCM without making anyassumption about functional forms. Second, we propose a novel dequantizationtrick to deal with discrete variables, which is a limitation of normalizingflows in general. Third, we demonstrate in experiments that c-GNF performson-par with IPW and RWR in terms of bias and variance for estimating the ATE,when the true functional forms are known, and better when they are unknown.Fourth and most importantly, we conduct counterfactual inference with c-GNFs,demonstrating promising empirical performance. Because IPW and RWR, like othertraditional methods, lack the capability of counterfactual inference, c-GNFswill likely play a major role in tailoring personalized treatment, facilitatingP$^3$A, optimizing social interventions - in contrast to the current`one-size-fits-all' approach of existing methods.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>25. <b>标题：On The Empirical Effectiveness of Unrealistic Adversarial Hardening  Against Realistic Adversarial Attacks</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[52]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03277</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Salijona Dyrmishi,  Salah Ghamizi,  Thibault Simonetto,  Yves Le Traon,  Maxime Cordy</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：evaluate whether unrealistic adversarial examples, makes two major contributions, results reveal discrepancies across, adversarial examples generated, unrealistic adversarial examples</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>While the literature on security attacks and defense of Machine Learning (ML)systems mostly focuses on unrealistic adversarial examples, recent research hasraised concern about the under-explored field of realistic adversarial attacksand their implications on the robustness of real-world systems.

For fast-increasing applications and data amounts, distributedlearning is a promising emerging paradigm since it is often impractical orinefficient to share/aggregate data to a centralized location from distinctones. This paper studies the problem of training an ML model over decentralizedsystems, where data are distributed over many user devices and the learningalgorithm run on-device, with the aim of relaxing the burden at a centralentity/server. Although gossip-based approaches have been used for this purposein different use cases, they suffer from high communication costs, especiallywhen the number of devices is large. To mitigate this, incremental-basedmethods are proposed. We first introduce incremental block-coordinate descent(I-BCD) for the decentralized ML, which can reduce communication costs at theexpense of running time. To accelerate the convergence speed, an asynchronousparallel incremental BCD (API-BCD) method is proposed, where multipledevices/agents are active in an asynchronous fashion. We derive convergenceproperties for the proposed methods. Simulation results also show that ourAPI-BCD method outperforms state of the art in terms of running time andcommunication costs.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>27. <b>标题：Theory-inspired Parameter Control Benchmarks for Dynamic Algorithm  Configuration</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[56]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03259</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：André Biedenkapp,  Nguyen Dang,  Martin S.

Mechanisms that identifysuitable configurations on the fly ("parameter control") or via a dedicatedtraining process ("dynamic algorithm configuration") are therefore an importantcomponent of modern evolutionary computation frameworks. Several approaches toaddress the dynamic parameter setting problem exist, but we barely understandwhich ones to prefer for which applications. As in classical benchmarking,problem collections with a known ground truth can offer very meaningfulinsights in this context. Unfortunately, settings with well-understood controlpolicies are very rare.One of the few exceptions for which we know which parameter settings minimizethe expected runtime is the LeadingOnes problem. We extend this benchmark byanalyzing optimal control policies that can select the parameters only from agiven portfolio of possible values. This also allows us to compute optimalparameter portfolios of a given size. We demonstrate the usefulness of ourbenchmarks by analyzing the behavior of the DDQN reinforcement learningapproach for dynamic algorithm configuration.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>28. <b>标题：ALM-KD: Knowledge Distillation with noisy labels via adaptive loss  mixing</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[59]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03250</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Durga Sivasubramanian,  Pradeep Shenoy,  Prathosh AP,  Ganesh Ramakrishnan</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：demonstrate performance gains obtained using, adaptive loss mixing scheme, using meta learning, validation metric signalling, specific convex combination</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Knowledge distillation is a technique where the outputs of a pretrainedmodel, often known as the teacher model is used for training a student model ina supervised setting.

Nevertheless, the prediction performance of steady-state models typicallydegrades with time due to the inherent nonstationarity of the underlyingprocess being modeled. Few studies have investigated how learning methods canbe applied to sustain the prediction accuracy of steady-state virtual flowmeters. This paper explores passive learning, where the model is frequentlycalibrated to new data, as a way to address nonstationarity and improvelong-term performance. An advantage with passive learning is that it iscompatible with models used in the industry. Two passive learning methods,periodic batch learning and online learning, are applied with varyingcalibration frequency to train virtual flow meters. Six different model types,ranging from data-driven to first-principles, are trained on historicalproduction data from 10 petroleum wells. The results are two-fold: first, inthe presence of frequently arriving measurements, frequent model updatingsustains an excellent prediction performance over time; second, in the presenceof intermittent and infrequently arriving measurements, frequent updating inaddition to the utilization of expert knowledge is essential to increase theperformance accuracy.

One drawback of the proposedarchitectures, which are often based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), is thatthey cannot generalize across the size of the output space from which variablesare assigned a value, for example, set of colors in a GCP, or board-size insudoku. We call the output space for the variables as 'value-set'. While manyworks have demonstrated generalization of GNNs across graph size, there hasbeen no study on how to design a GNN for achieving value-set invariance forproblems that come from the same domain. For example, learning to solve 16 x 16sudoku after being trained on only 9 x 9 sudokus. In this work, we proposenovel methods to extend GNN based architectures to achieve value-setinvariance. Specifically, our model builds on recently proposed RecurrentRelational Networks. Our first approach exploits the graph-size invariance ofGNNs by converting a multi-class node classification problem into a binary nodeclassification problem. Our second approach works directly with multipleclasses by adding multiple nodes corresponding to the values in the value-set,and then connecting variable nodes to value nodes depending on the probleminitialization. Our experimental evaluation on three different combinatorialproblems demonstrates that both our models perform well on our novel problem,compared to a generic neural reasoner. Between two of our models, we observe aninherent trade-off: while the binarized model gives better performance whentrained on smaller value-sets, multi-valued model is much more memoryefficient, resulting in improved performance when trained on larger value-sets,where binarized model fails to train.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>34. <b>标题：Introducing explainable supervised machine learning into interactive  feedback loops for statistical production system</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[72]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03212</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Carlos Mougan,  George Kanellos,  Johannes Micheler,  Jose Martinez,  Thomas Gottron</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Irving Fisher Committee (IFC) - Bank of Italy workshop on Data science in central banking: Applications and tools. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.08045</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：statistical production systems cover multiple steps, national central banks thereby improving, tasks like data quality assurance, explainable ai taxonomy aiming, different explainable ai needs</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Statistical production systems cover multiple steps from the collection,aggregation, and integration of data to tasks like data quality assurance anddissemination.

GNNs have recently become a widely usedgraph analysis method due to their superior ability to learn representationsfor complex graph data. However, due to privacy concerns and regulationrestrictions, centralized GNNs can be difficult to apply to data-sensitivescenarios. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging technology developed forprivacy-preserving settings when several parties need to train a shared globalmodel collaboratively. Although many research works have applied FL to trainGNNs (Federated GNNs), there is no research on their robustness to backdoorattacks.This paper bridges this gap by conducting two types of backdoor attacks inFederated GNNs: centralized backdoor attacks (CBA) and distributed backdoorattacks (DBA). CBA is conducted by embedding the same global trigger duringtraining for every malicious party, while DBA is conducted by decomposing aglobal trigger into separate local triggers and embedding them into thetraining dataset of different malicious parties, respectively. Our experimentsshow that the DBA attack success rate is higher than CBA in almost allevaluated cases, while rarely, the DBA attack performance is close to CBA. ForCBA, the attack success rate of all local triggers is similar to the globaltrigger even if the training set of the adversarial party is embedded with theglobal trigger. To further explore the properties of two backdoor attacks inFederated GNNs, we evaluate the attack performance for different trigger sizes,poisoning intensities, and trigger densities, with trigger density being themost influential.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>38. <b>标题：Network Resource Allocation Strategy Based on Deep Reinforcement  Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[81]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03193</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Shidong Zhang,  Chao Wang,  Junsan Zhang,  Youxiang Duan,  Xinhong You,  Peiying Zhang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：existing vne algorithm often ignores, supports shows great potential, solving resource allocation problems, neural network model close, stage vne algorithm based</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The traditional Internet has encountered a bottleneck in allocating networkresources for emerging technology needs.

Extensiveefforts have been made recently to develop smart skin-like sensors to extendthe capabilities of biological skins; however, simultaneous sensing of severaltypes of stimuli in a large area remains challenging because this requireslarge-scale sensor integration with numerous wire connections. We propose asimple, highly sensitive, and multimodal sensing approach, which does notrequire integrating multiple sensors. The proposed approach is based on anoptical interference technique, which can encode the information of variousstimuli as a spatial pattern. In contrast to the existing approach, theproposed approach, combined with a deep neural network, enables us to freelyselect the sensing mode according to our purpose. As a key example, wedemonstrate simultaneous sensing mode of three different physical quantities,contact force, contact location, and temperature, using a single soft materialwithout requiring complex integration. Another unique property of the proposedapproach is spatially continuous sensing with ultrahigh resolution of few tensof micrometers, which enables identifying the shape of the object in contact.Furthermore, we present a haptic soft device for a human-machine interface.

Thecorresponding car-following models, which describe how one vehicle followsanother vehicle in the traffic flow, form the cornerstone for microscopictraffic simulation and intelligent vehicle development. One major motivation ofcar-following models is to replicate human drivers' longitudinal drivingtrajectories. To model the long-term dependency of future actions on historicaldriving situations, we developed a long-sequence car-following trajectoryprediction model based on the attention-based Transformer model. The modelfollows a general format of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder takeshistorical speed and spacing data as inputs and forms a mixed representation ofhistorical driving context using multi-head self-attention. The decoder takesthe future LV speed profile as input and outputs the predicted future FV speedprofile in a generative way (instead of an auto-regressive way, avoidingcompounding errors). Through cross-attention between encoder and decoder, thedecoder learns to build a connection between historical driving and future LVspeed, based on which a prediction of future FV speed can be obtained.

Thestate-of-the-art approaches of knowledge graph embeddings and/or rule miningand reasoning are data-driven and, thus, solely based on the information theinput knowledge graph contains. This leads to unsatisfactory prediction resultswhich make such solutions inapplicable to crucial domains such as healthcare.To further enhance the accuracy of knowledge graph completion we propose toloosely-couple the data-driven power of knowledge graph embeddings withdomain-specific reasoning stemming from experts or entailment regimes (e.g.,OWL2). In this way, we not only enhance the prediction accuracy with domainknowledge that may not be included in the input knowledge graph but also allowusers to plugin their own knowledge graph embedding and reasoning method. Ourinitial results show that we enhance the MRR accuracy of vanilla knowledgegraph embeddings by up to 3x and outperform hybrid solutions that combineknowledge graph embeddings with rule mining and reasoning up to 3.5x MRR.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>42. <b>标题：CITRIS: Causal Identifiability from Temporal Intervened Sequences</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[94]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03169</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Phillip Lippe,  Sara Magliacane,  Sindy Löwe,  Yuki M.

In this paper, we propose CITRIS, a variational autoencoderframework that learns causal representations from temporal sequences of imagesin which underlying causal factors have possibly been intervened upon. Incontrast to the recent literature, CITRIS exploits temporality and observingintervention targets to identify scalar and multidimensional causal factors,such as 3D rotation angles. Furthermore, by introducing a normalizing flow,CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representationsobtained by already pretrained autoencoders. Extending previous results onscalar causal factors, we prove identifiability in a more general setting, inwhich only some components of a causal factor are affected by interventions. Inexperiments on 3D rendered image sequences, CITRIS outperforms previous methodson recovering the underlying causal variables. Moreover, using pretrainedautoencoders, CITRIS can even generalize to unseen instantiations of causalfactors, opening future research areas in sim-to-real generalization for causalrepresentation learning.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>43. <b>标题：Bayesian Linear Bandits for Large-Scale Recommender Systems</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[95]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03167</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Saeed Ghoorchian,  Setareh Maghsudi</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：10 pages, 2 figures</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：policy employs thompson sampling, available side information boosts, proposed recommender system follows, dimensionality reduction follows, reduced dimension instead</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Potentially, taking advantage of available side information boosts theperformance of recommender systems; nevertheless, with the rise of big data,the side information has often several dimensions. Hence, it is imperative todevelop decision-making algorithms that can cope with such a high-dimensionalcontext in real-time. That is especially challenging when the decision-makerhas a variety of items to recommend. In this paper, we build upon the linearcontextual multi-armed bandit framework to address this problem. We develop adecision-making policy for a linear bandit problem with high-dimensionalcontext vectors and several arms. Our policy employs Thompson sampling andfeeds it with reduced context vectors, where the dimensionality reductionfollows by random projection. Our proposed recommender system follows thispolicy to learn online the item preferences of users while keeping its runtimeas low as possible. We prove a regret bound that scales as a factor of thereduced dimension instead of the original one. For numerical evaluation, we useour algorithm to build a recommender system and apply it to real-worlddatasets. The theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the effectivenessof our proposed algorithm compared to the state-of-the-art in terms ofcomputational complexity and regret performance.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>44. <b>标题：Over-the-Air Ensemble Inference with Model Privacy</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[110]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03129</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Selim F.

Unfortunately, it isdifficult to preserve semantics well during augmentations in view of thediverse nature of graph data. Currently, data augmentations in GCL that aredesigned to preserve semantics broadly fall into three unsatisfactory ways.First, the augmentations can be manually picked per dataset bytrial-and-errors. Second, the augmentations can be selected via cumbersomesearch. Third, the augmentations can be obtained by introducing expensivedomain-specific knowledge as guidance. All of these limit the efficiency andmore general applicability of existing GCL methods. To circumvent these crucialissues, we propose a \underline{Sim}ple framework for \underline{GRA}ph\underline{C}ontrastive l\underline{E}arning, \textbf{SimGRACE} for brevity,which does not require data augmentations. Specifically, we take original graphas input and GNN model with its perturbed version as two encoders to obtain twocorrelated views for contrast. SimGRACE is inspired by the observation thatgraph data can preserve their semantics well during encoder perturbations whilenot requiring manual trial-and-errors, cumbersome search or expensive domainknowledge for augmentations selection. Also, we explain why SimGRACE cansucceed. Furthermore, we devise adversarial training scheme, dubbed\textbf{AT-SimGRACE}, to enhance the robustness of graph contrastive learningand theoretically explain the reasons. Albeit simple, we show that SimGRACE canyield competitive or better performance compared with state-of-the-art methodsin terms of generalizability, transferability and robustness, while enjoyingunprecedented degree of flexibility and efficiency.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>47. <b>标题：Combining Deep Learning and Reasoning for Address Detection in  Unstructured Text Documents</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[116]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03103</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Matthias Engelbach,  Dennis Klau,  Jens Drawehn,  Maximilien Kintz</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：5 pages, 1 figure, submitted to AAAI-22 workshop CLeaR, peer reviewed</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：containing text using domain knowledge represented, sender address would boost many companies, visual deep learning model, crucial document information like, possible address regions</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Extracting information from unstructured text documents is a demanding task,since these documents can have a broad variety of different layouts and anon-trivial reading order, like it is the case for multi-column documents ornested tables.

However,it usually requires training each pairwise combination of tasks together inorder to capture task relationships, at an extremely high computational cost.In this work, we learn task relationships via an automated weighting framework,named Auto-Lambda. Unlike previous methods where task relationships are assumedto be fixed, Auto-Lambda is a gradient-based meta learning framework whichexplores continuous, dynamic task relationships via task-specific weightings,and can optimise any choice of combination of tasks through the formulation ofa meta-loss; where the validation loss automatically influences task weightingsthroughout training. We apply the proposed framework to both multi-task andauxiliary learning problems in computer vision and robotics, and show thatAuto-Lambda achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared tooptimisation strategies designed specifically for each problem and data domain.Finally, we observe that Auto-Lambda can discover interesting learningbehaviors, leading to new insights in multi-task learning.

Various representation debiasing techniques have been proposed inthe literature. However, as neural networks are inherently opaque, thesemethods are hard to comprehend, which limits their usefulness. We propose a newframework for fair representation learning that is centered around the learningof "correction vectors", which have the same dimensionality as the given datavectors. Correction vectors may be computed either explicitly via architecturalconstraints or implicitly by training an invertible model based on NormalizingFlows. We show experimentally that several fair representation learning modelsconstrained in such a way do not exhibit losses in ranking or classificationperformance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art results can beachieved by the invertible model.

People tend to employ TSTs as trusted basic tools and rarelyhave any doubt about their reliability. This paper systematically uncovers thefailure mode of non-parametric TSTs through adversarial attacks and thenproposes corresponding defense strategies. First, we theoretically show that anadversary can upper-bound the distributional shift which guarantees theattack's invisibility. Furthermore, we theoretically find that the adversarycan also degrade the lower bound of a TST's test power, which enables us toiteratively minimize the test criterion in order to search for adversarialpairs. To enable TST-agnostic attacks, we propose an ensemble attack (EA)framework that jointly minimizes the different types of test criteria. Second,to robustify TSTs, we propose a max-min optimization that iteratively generatesadversarial pairs to train the deep kernels. Extensive experiments on bothsimulated and real-world datasets validate the adversarial vulnerabilities ofnon-parametric TSTs and the effectiveness of our proposed defense.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>52. <b>标题：Distributionally Robust Fair Principal Components via Geodesic Descents</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[131]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03071</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Hieu Vu,  Toan Tran,  Man-Chung Yue,  Viet Anh Nguyen</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：simple yet useful dimensionality reduction technique, riemannian subgradient descent algorithm, modern machine learning pipelines, distributionally robust optimization problem, learned projection thus balances</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Principal component analysis is a simple yet useful dimensionality reductiontechnique in modern machine learning pipelines.

In this paper, we argue that non-Markovianity isinstead paramount for maximum state entropy exploration in a finite-sampleregime. Especially, we recast the objective to target the expected entropy ofthe induced state visitations in a single trial. Then, we show that the classof non-Markovian deterministic policies is sufficient for the introducedobjective, while Markovian policies suffer non-zero regret in general. However,we prove that the problem of finding an optimal non-Markovian policy is atleast NP-complete.

Traditionally, the study of submodular functions was based onbinary function properties. However, such properties have an inherit weakness,namely, if an algorithm assumes functions that have a particular property, thenit provides no guarantee for functions that violate this property, even whenthe violation is very slight. Therefore, recent works began to considercontinuous versions of function properties. Probably the most significant amongthese (so far) are the submodularity ratio and the curvature, which werestudied extensively together and separately.The monotonicity property of set functions plays a central role in submodularmaximization. Nevertheless, and despite all the above works, no continuousversion of this property has been suggested to date (as far as we know). Thisis unfortunate since submoduar functions that are almost monotone often arisein machine learning applications. In this work we fill this gap by defining themonotonicity ratio, which is a continues version of the monotonicity property.We then show that for many standard submodular maximization algorithms one canprove new approximation guarantees that depend on the monotonicity ratio;leading to improved approximation ratios for the common machine learningapplications of movie recommendation, quadratic programming and imagesummarization.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>59. <b>标题：Metric-valued regression</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[145]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03045</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Dan Tsir Cohen,  Aryeh Kontorovich</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：consistent whenever $\ x, {\ em semi, stable compression },, somewhat weakened )., two metric spaces</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>We propose an efficient algorithm for learning mappings between two metricspaces, $\X$ and $\Y$.

On this space, we explore the errorlandscape rather than the loss. This lets us derive a meaningful notion of theflatness of minimizers and of the geodesic paths connecting them. Usingdifferent optimization algorithms that sample minimizers with differentflatness we study the mode connectivity and other characteristics. Testing avariety of state-of-the-art architectures and benchmark datasets, we confirmthe correlation between flatness and generalization performance; we furthershow that in function space flatter minima are closer to each other and thatthe barriers along the geodesics connecting them are small. We also find thatminimizers found by variants of gradient descent can be connected by zero-errorpaths with a single bend. We observe similar qualitative results in neuralnetworks with binary weights and activations, providing one of the firstresults concerning the connectivity in this setting. Our results hinge onsymmetry removal, and are in remarkable agreement with the rich phenomenologydescribed by some recent analytical studies performed on simple shallow models.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>61. <b>标题：CECILIA: Comprehensive Secure Machine Learning Framework</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[153]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03023</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Ali Burak Ünal,  Mete Akgün,  Nico Pfeifer</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：~8 pages of the main paper, ~1 of Supplement, submitted to ICML 2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：sensitive information enforce privacy preserving machine learning algorithms, offering privacy preserving building blocks, since machine learning algorithms, first study ever accomplishing, high computational power required</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Since machine learning algorithms have proven their success in data miningtasks, the data with sensitive information enforce privacy preserving machinelearning algorithms to emerge. Moreover, the increase in the number of datasources and the high computational power required by those algorithms forceindividuals to outsource the training and/or the inference of a machinelearning model to the clouds providing such services. To address this dilemma,we propose a secure 3-party computation framework, CECILIA, offering privacypreserving building blocks to enable more complex operations privately. Amongthose building blocks, we have two novel methods, which are the exactexponential of a public base raised to the power of a secret value and theinverse square root of a secret Gram matrix. We employ CECILIA to realize theprivate inference on pre-trained recurrent kernel networks, which require morecomplex operations than other deep neural networks such as convolutional neuralnetworks, on the structural classification of proteins as the first study everaccomplishing the privacy preserving inference on recurrent kernel networks.The results demonstrate that we perform the exact and fully private exponentialcomputation, which is done by approximation in the literature so far. Moreover,we can also perform the exact inverse square root of a secret Gram matrixcomputation up to a certain privacy level, which has not been addressed in theliterature at all. We also analyze the scalability of CECILIA to varioussettings on a synthetic dataset. The framework shows a great promise to makeother machine learning algorithms as well as further computations privatelycomputable by the building blocks of the framework.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>62. <b>标题：B2EA: An Evolutionary Algorithm Assisted by Two Bayesian Optimization  Modules for Neural Architecture Search</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[159]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03005</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Hyunghun Cho,  Jungwook Shin,  Wonjong Rhee</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：23 pages, submitted to ICML22</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：early pioneering neural architecture search, key strategies including evolutionary algorithm, two bo surrogate models, structured search space typically, subsequent works took advantage</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The early pioneering Neural Architecture Search (NAS) works were multi-trialmethods applicable to any general search space.

For accurate bounds, modelsimplifications should be avoided even in large networks. Network Calculus (NC)provides a modeling framework and different analyses for delay bounding. Weinvestigate the analysis of feedforward networks where all queues implementFirst-In First-Out (FIFO) service. Correctly considering the effect of dataflows onto each other under FIFO is already a challenging task. Yet, thefastest available NC FIFO analysis suffers from limitations resulting inunnecessarily loose bounds. A feature called Flow Prolongation (FP) has beenshown to improve delay bound accuracy significantly. Unfortunately, FP needs tobe executed within the NC FIFO analysis very often and each time it creates anexponentially growing set of alternative networks with prolongations. FPtherefore does not scale and has been out of reach for the exhaustive analysisof large networks. We introduce DeepFP, an approach to make FP scale bypredicting prolongations using machine learning. In our evaluation, we showthat DeepFP can improve results in FIFO networks considerably. Compared to thestandard NC FIFO analysis, DeepFP reduces delay bounds by 12.1% on average atnegligible additional computational cost.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>64. <b>标题：Graph Self-supervised Learning with Accurate Discrepancy Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[164]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02989</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Dongki Kim,  Jinheon Baek,  Sung Ju Hwang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：8 pages</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：two differently perturbed graphs may result, model largely outperforms relevant baselines, cannot discriminate two similar graphs, including molecular property prediction, cannot learn global graph</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Self-supervised learning of graph neural networks (GNNs) aims to learn anaccurate representation of the graphs in an unsupervised manner, to obtaintransferable representations of them for diverse downstream tasks. Predictivelearning and contrastive learning are the two most prevalent approaches forgraph self-supervised learning. However, they have their own drawbacks. Whilethe predictive learning methods can learn the contextual relationships betweenneighboring nodes and edges, they cannot learn global graph-level similarities.Contrastive learning, while it can learn global graph-level similarities, itsobjective to maximize the similarity between two differently perturbed graphsmay result in representations that cannot discriminate two similar graphs withdifferent properties. To tackle such limitations, we propose a framework thataims to learn the exact discrepancy between the original and the perturbedgraphs, coined as Discrepancy-based Self-supervised LeArning (D-SLA).Specifically, we create multiple perturbations of the given graph with varyingdegrees of similarity and train the model to predict whether each graph is theoriginal graph or a perturbed one. Moreover, we further aim to accuratelycapture the amount of discrepancy for each perturbed graph using the graph editdistance. We validate our method on various graph-related downstream tasks,including molecular property prediction, protein function prediction, and linkprediction tasks, on which our model largely outperforms relevant baselines.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>65. <b>标题：Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis of Deep Narrow Neural Networks</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[166]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02981</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Jongmin Lee,  Joo Young Choi,  Ernest K.

In real-worldapplications, e.g., healthcare applications, the data collected by a singleorganization (e.g., hospital) is often limited, and the majority of massive anddiverse data is often segregated across multiple organizations. As such, itmotivates the researchers to conduct distributed deep learning, where the datauser would like to build DL models using the data segregated across multipledifferent data owners. However, this could lead to severe privacy concerns dueto the sensitive nature of the data, thus the data owners would be hesitant andreluctant to participate. We propose LDP-DL, a privacy-preserving distributeddeep learning framework via local differential privacy and knowledgedistillation, where each data owner learns a teacher model using its own(local) private dataset, and the data user learns a student model to mimic theoutput of the ensemble of the teacher models. In the experimental evaluation, acomprehensive comparison has been made among our proposed approach (i.e.,LDP-DL), DP-SGD, PATE and DP-FL, using three popular deep learning benchmarkdatasets (i.e., CIFAR10, MNIST and FashionMNIST).

During exploration, sparse but high-quality data are gatheredto assess the overall orebody. During the mining process, boundary positionsand material properties are refined as the mine progresses. This refinement isfacilitated through drilling, material logging, and chemical assaying. Materialtype logging suffers from a high degree of variability due to factors such asthe diversity in mineralization and geology, the subjective nature of humanmeasurement even by experts, and human error in manually recording results.While laboratory-based chemical assaying is much more precise, it istime-consuming and costly and does not always capture or correlate boundarypositions between all material types. This leads to significant challenges andfinancial implications for the industry, as the accuracy of productionblasthole logging and assaying processes is essential for resource evaluation,planning, and execution of mine plans. To overcome these challenges, this workreports on a pilot study to automate the process of material logging andchemical assaying. A machine learning approach has been trained on featuresextracted from measurement-while-drilling (MWD) data, logged from autonomousdrilling systems (ADS). MWD data facilitate the construction of profiles ofphysical drilling parameters as a function of hole depth. A hypothesis isformed to link these drilling parameters to the underlying mineral composition.The results of the pilot study discussed in this paper demonstrate thefeasibility of this process, with correlation coefficients of up to 0.92 forchemical assays and 93% accuracy for material detection, depending on thematerial or assay type and their generalization across the different spatialregions.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>70. <b>标题：Jury Learning: Integrating Dissenting Voices into Machine Learning  Models</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[180]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02950</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Mitchell L.

For example, a jury learning model for online toxicity mightcentrally feature women and Black jurors, who are commonly targets of onlineharassment. To enable jury learning, we contribute a deep learning architecturethat models every annotator in a dataset, samples from annotators' models topopulate the jury, then runs inference to classify.

However, this may lead to unsatisfactory performance for the new task,especially when the new task is strongly correlated with old tasks. To tacklethis challenge, we propose Trust Region Gradient Projection (TRGP) forcontinual learning to facilitate the forward knowledge transfer based on anefficient characterization of task correlation. Particularly, we introduce anotion of `trust region' to select the most related old tasks for the new taskin a layer-wise and single-shot manner, using the norm of gradient projectiononto the subspace spanned by task inputs. Then, a scaled weight projection isproposed to cleverly reuse the frozen weights of the selected old tasks in thetrust region through a layer-wise scaling matrix.

Offline Meta-RL is emerging as a promising approach toaddress these challenges, aiming to learn an informative meta-policy from acollection of tasks. Nevertheless, as shown in our empirical studies, offlineMeta-RL could be outperformed by offline single-task RL methods on tasks withgood quality of datasets, indicating that a right balance has to be delicatelycalibrated between "exploring" the out-of-distribution state-actions byfollowing the meta-policy and "exploiting" the offline dataset by staying closeto the behavior policy. Motivated by such empirical analysis, we exploremodel-based offline Meta-RL with regularized Policy Optimization (MerPO), whichlearns a meta-model for efficient task structure inference and an informativemeta-policy for safe exploration of out-of-distribution state-actions. Inparticular, we devise a new meta-Regularized model-based Actor-Critic (RAC)method for within-task policy optimization, as a key building block of MerPO,using conservative policy evaluation and regularized policy improvement; andthe intrinsic tradeoff therein is achieved via striking the right balancebetween two regularizers, one based on the behavior policy and the other on themeta-policy. We theoretically show that the learnt policy offers guaranteedimprovement over both the behavior policy and the meta-policy, thus ensuringthe performance improvement on new tasks via offline Meta-RL.

Nowadays, there is an urgent need for institutionsand organizations to train a model cooperatively while keeping each other'sdata privately. To address the issue of privacy-preserving in collaborativelearning, secure outsourced computation and federated learning are two typicalmethods. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks for these two methods when theyare leveraged in cooperative learning. For secure outsourced computation,semi-honest servers need to be introduced. Once the outsourced servers colludeor perform other active attacks, the privacy of data will be disclosed. Forfederated learning, it is difficult to apply to the scenarios where verticallypartitioned data are distributed over multiple parties. In this work, wepropose a multi-party mixed protocol framework, ABG$^n$, which effectivelyimplements arbitrary conversion between Arithmetic sharing (A), Boolean sharing(B) and Garbled-Circuits sharing (G) for $n$-party scenarios. Based on ABG$^n$,we design a privacy-preserving multi-party cooperative learning system, whichallows different data owners to cooperate in machine learning in terms of datasecurity and privacy-preserving. Additionally, we design specificprivacy-preserving computation protocols for some typical machine learningmethods such as logistic regression and neural networks. Compared with previouswork, the proposed method has a wider scope of application and does not need torely on additional servers. Finally, we evaluate the performance of ABG$^n$ onthe local setting and on the public cloud setting.

However, it is unclear how to acquire newskills when objectives and constraints are in conflict with previously learnedskills. Moreover, when retraining, there is an intrinsic conflict betweenexploiting what has already been learned and exploring new skills. In softactor-critic (SAC) methods, a temperature parameter can be dynamically adjustedto weight the action entropy and balance the explore $\times$ exploittrade-off. However, controlling a single coefficient can be challenging withinthe context of retraining, even more so when goals are contradictory.

However, in thisstudy, we prove that the existing DC methods can perform worse than the randomselection method when task-irrelevant information forms a significant part ofthe training dataset. We attribute this to the lack of participation of thecontrastive signals between the classes resulting from the class-wise gradientmatching strategy. To address this problem, we propose Dataset Condensationwith Contrastive signals (DCC) by modifying the loss function to enable the DCmethods to effectively capture the differences between classes. In addition, weanalyze the new loss function in terms of training dynamics by tracking thekernel velocity. Furthermore, we introduce a bi-level warm-up strategy tostabilize the optimization. Our experimental results indicate that while theexisting methods are ineffective for fine-grained image classification tasks,the proposed method can successfully generate informative synthetic datasetsfor the same tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed methodoutperforms the baselines even on benchmark datasets such as SVHN, CIFAR-10,and CIFAR-100.

Recent years have therefore witnessed great effort in developingcausal learning algorithms aiming to help AI achieve human-level intelligence.Due to the lack-of ground-truth data, one of the biggest challenges in currentcausal learning research is algorithm evaluations. This largely impedes thecross-pollination of AI and causal inference, and hinders the two fields tobenefit from the advances of the other. To bridge from conventional causalinference (i.e., based on statistical methods) to causal learning with big data(i.e., the intersection of causal inference and machine learning), in thissurvey, we review commonly-used datasets, evaluation methods, and measures forcausal learning using an evaluation pipeline similar to conventional machinelearning. We focus on the two fundamental causal-inference tasks andcausality-aware machine learning tasks. Limitations of current evaluationprocedures are also discussed. We then examine popular causal inferencetools/packages and conclude with primary challenges and opportunities forbenchmarking causal learning algorithms in the era of big data. The surveyseeks to bring to the forefront the urgency of developing publicly availablebenchmarks and consensus-building standards for causal learning evaluation withobservational data. In doing so, we hope to broaden the discussions andfacilitate collaboration to advance the innovation and application of causallearning.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>83. <b>标题：Effects of Parametric and Non-Parametric Methods on High Dimensional  Sparse Matrix Representations</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[209]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02894</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Sayali Tambe,  Raunak Joshi,  Abhishek Gupta,  Nandan Kanvinde,  Vidya Chitre</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：7 pages, 6 tables, 13 equations</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：performed classification using linear discriminant analysis, high dimensional sparse matrix representations, high dimensional sparse matrix, every single algorithm detailed, every single dimension</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The semantics are derived from textual data that provide representations forMachine Learning algorithms.

Thisresult was reported recently to facilitate model-based supervised learning butit can be interpreted in a causality context as follows. One can compile anon-parametric causal graph into an arithmetic circuit that supports inferencein time linear in the circuit size. The circuit is also non-parametric so itcan be used to estimate parameters from data and to further reason (in lineartime) about the causal graph parametrized by these estimates. Moreover, thecircuit size can sometimes be bounded even when the treewidth of the causalgraph is not, leading to tractable inference on models that have been deemedintractable previously. This has been enabled by a new technique that canexploit causal mechanisms computationally but without needing to know theiridentities (the classical setup in causal inference).

The problem is further aggravated by the fact that holisticmobility management solutions for different types of handovers, namelyinter-frequency and intra-frequency handovers, remain scarce. This paperpresents a first mobility management solution that concurrently optimizesinter-frequency related A5 parameters and intra-frequency related A3parameters. We analyze and optimize five parameters namely A5-time to trigger(TTT), A5-threshold1, A5-threshold2, A3-TTT, and A3-offset to jointly maximizethree critical key performance indicators (KPIs): edge user reference signalreceived power (RSRP), handover success rate (HOSR) and load between frequencybands. In the absence of tractable analytical models due to system levelcomplexity, we leverage machine learning to quantify the KPIs as a function ofthe mobility parameters. An XGBoost based model has the best performance foredge RSRP and HOSR while random forest outperforms others for load prediction.An analysis of the mobility parameters provides several insights: 1) thereexists a strong coupling between A3 and A5 parameters; 2) an optimal set ofparameters exists for each KPI; and 3) the optimal parameters vary fordifferent KPIs. We also perform a SHAP based sensitivity to help resolve theparametric conflict between the KPIs. Finally, we formulate a maximizationproblem, show it is non-convex, and solve it utilizing simulated annealing(SA).

For this problem, one would like to compress themodel updates so as to minimize the resulting loss in accuracy. In this paper,we take a rate-distortion approach to answer this question for the distributedtraining of a deep neural network (DNN). In particular, we define a measure ofthe compression performance, the \emph{per-bit accuracy}, which addresses theultimate model accuracy that a bit of communication brings to the centralizedmodel. In order to maximize the per-bit accuracy, we consider modeling thegradient updates at remote learners as a generalized normal distribution. Underthis assumption on the model update distribution, we propose a class ofdistortion measures for the design of quantizer for the compression of themodel updates. We argue that this family of distortion measures, which we referto as "$M$-magnitude weighted $L_2$" norm, capture the practitioner intuitionin the choice of gradient compressor. Numerical simulations are provided tovalidate the proposed approach.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>96. <b>标题：Low-confidence Samples Matter for Domain Adaptation</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[244]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02802</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yixin Zhang,  Junjie Li,  Zilei Wang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：11 pages, 5 figures</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：build reliable pseudo labels, intermediate representations across domains, novel contrastive learning method, way would overlook, instance discrimination process</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich sourcedomain to a related but label-scarce target domain. The conventional DAstrategy is to align the feature distributions of the two domains. Recently,increasing researches have focused on self-training or other semi-supervisedalgorithms to explore the data structure of the target domain. However, thebulk of them depend largely on confident samples in order to build reliablepseudo labels, prototypes or cluster centers. Representing the target datastructure in such a way would overlook the huge low-confidence samples,resulting in sub-optimal transferability that is biased towards the samplessimilar to the source domain. To overcome this issue, we propose a novelcontrastive learning method by processing low-confidence samples, whichencourages the model to make use of the target data structure through theinstance discrimination process. To be specific, we create positive andnegative pairs only using low-confidence samples, and then re-represent theoriginal features with the classifier weights rather than directly utilizingthem, which can better encode the task-specific semantic information.Furthermore, we combine cross-domain mixup to augment the proposed contrastiveloss. Consequently, the domain gap can be well bridged through contrastivelearning of intermediate representations across domains. We evaluate theproposed method in both unsupervised and semi-supervised DA settings, andextensive experimental results on benchmarks reveal that our method iseffective and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Such efficient estimation is critical for tasks whereit is prohibitive to scan the data even once. Existing sample-based estimatorstypically rely on heuristics or assumptions and do not have robust performanceacross different datasets as the assumptions on data can easily break. On theother hand, deriving an estimator from a principled formulation such as maximumlikelihood estimation is very challenging due to the complex structure of theformulation. We propose to formulate the NDV estimation task in a supervisedlearning framework, and aim to learn a model as the estimator. To this end, weneed to answer several questions: i) how to make the learned model workloadagnostic; ii) how to obtain training data; iii) how to perform model training.We derive conditions of the learning framework under which the learned model isworkload agnostic, in the sense that the model/estimator can be trained withsynthetically generated training data, and then deployed into any datawarehouse simply as, e.g., user-defined functions (UDFs), to offer efficient(within microseconds on CPU) and accurate NDV estimations for unseen tables andworkloads.

We show that an agent, after being trainedexclusively on the SE, is able to solve the corresponding real environment.While an SE acts as a full proxy to a real environment by learning about itsstate dynamics and rewards, an RN is a partial proxy that learns to augment orreplace rewards. We use bi-level optimization to evolve SEs and RNs: the innerloop trains the RL agent, and the outer loop trains the parameters of the SE /RN via an evolution strategy. We evaluate our proposed new concept on a broadrange of RL algorithms and classic control environments. In a one-to-onecomparison, learning an SE proxy requires more interactions with the realenvironment than training agents only on the real environment. However, oncesuch an SE has been learned, we do not need any interactions with the realenvironment to train new agents. Moreover, the learned SE proxies allow us totrain agents with fewer interactions while maintaining the original taskperformance. Our empirical results suggest that SEs achieve this result bylearning informed representations that bias the agents towards relevant states.Moreover, we find that these proxies are robust against hyperparametervariation and can also transfer to unseen agents.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>101. <b>标题：Energy awareness in low precision neural networks</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[252]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02783</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Nurit Spingarn Eliezer,  Ron Banner,  Elad Hoffer,  Hilla Ben-Yaakov,  Tomer Michaeli</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：develop accurate power consumption models, reveal several important factors, reducing power consumption rely, aware neural network ),, deep neural networks</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Power consumption is a major obstacle in the deployment of deep neuralnetworks (DNNs) on end devices. Existing approaches for reducing powerconsumption rely on quite general principles, including avoidance ofmultiplication operations and aggressive quantization of weights andactivations. However, these methods do not take into account the precise powerconsumed by each module in the network, and are therefore not optimal. In thispaper we develop accurate power consumption models for all arithmeticoperations in the DNN, under various working conditions. We reveal severalimportant factors that have been overlooked to date. Based on our analysis, wepresent PANN (power-aware neural network), a simple approach for approximatingany full-precision network by a low-power fixed-precision variant. Our methodcan be applied to a pre-trained network, and can also be used during trainingto achieve improved performance. In contrast to previous methods, PANN incursonly a minor degradation in accuracy w.r.t. the full-precision version of thenetwork, even when working at the power-budget of a 2-bit quantized variant.

When designing an efficient network,trainable layers such as the depthwise convolution is the source of efficiencyin the number of parameters and FLOPs, but there was little improvement to themodel speed in practice. This paper argues that simple built-in parameter-freeoperations can be a favorable alternative to the efficient trainable layersreplacing spatial operations in a network architecture. We aim to break thestereotype of organizing the spatial operations of building blocks intotrainable layers. Extensive experimental analyses based on layer-level studieswith fully-trained models and neural architecture searches are provided toinvestigate whether parameter-free operations such as the max-pool arefunctional.

However, these defenses implicitly assume that humans areincapable of producing meaningful and targeted adversarial examples. In thispaper, we show that this base assumption is wrong. In particular, wedemonstrate that for tasks like speaker identification, a human is capable ofproducing analog adversarial examples directly with little cost andsupervision: by simply speaking through a tube, an adversary reliablyimpersonates other speakers in eyes of ML models for speaker identification.Our findings extend to a range of other acoustic-biometric tasks such asliveness, bringing into question their use in security-critical settings inreal life, such as phone banking.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>107. <b>标题：Energy-Aware Edge Association for Cluster-based Personalized Federated  Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[269]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02727</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Y.

Inthis sense, clustered federated learning is proposed to group user devices withsimilar preference and provide each cluster with a personalized model. Thiscalls for innovative design in edge association that involves user clusteringand also resource management optimization. We formulate an accuracy-costtrade-off optimization problem by jointly considering model accuracy,communication resource allocation and energy consumption. To comply withparameter encryption techniques in FL, we propose an iterative solutionprocedure which employs deep reinforcement learning based approach at cloudserver for edge association.

However,such datasets are often small, making the training of deep neural networkarchitectures ineffective. For time-series, the suite of data augmentationtricks we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need tomaintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a GenerativeAdversarial Network (GAN) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool.RNN-based GANs suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model longsequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle theseproblems, we introduce TTS-GAN, a transformer-based GAN which can successfullygenerate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length,similar to the real ones.

Recent work proposed theuse of function names as semantic cues that can be learned by a deep neuralnetwork (DNN) to aid in the hunt for vulnerability of functions.Combining identifier splitting, which splits each function name into itsconstituent words, with a novel frequency-based algorithm, we explore theextent to which the words that make up a function's name can predictpotentially vulnerable functions. In contrast to *lightweight* predictions by aDNN that considers only function names, avoiding the use of a DNN provides*featherweight* predictions. The underlying idea is that function names thatcontain certain "dangerous" words are more likely to accompany vulnerablefunctions. Of course, this assumes that the frequency-based algorithm can beproperly tuned to focus on truly dangerous words.Because it is more transparent than a DNN, the frequency-based algorithmenables us to investigate the inner workings of the DNN. If successful, thisinvestigation into what the DNN does and does not learn will help us train moreeffective future models.We empirically evaluate our approach on a heterogeneous dataset containingover 73000 functions labeled vulnerable, and over 950000 functions labeledbenign. Our analysis shows that words alone account for a significant portionof the DNN's classification ability. We also find that words are of greatestvalue in the datasets with a more homogeneous vocabulary. Thus, when workingwithin the scope of a given project, where the vocabulary is unavoidablyhomogeneous, our approach provides a cheaper, potentially complementary,technique to aid in the hunt for source-code vulnerabilities. Finally, thisapproach has the advantage that it is viable with orders of magnitude lesstraining data.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>114. <b>标题：Simulation-to-Reality domain adaptation for offline 3D object annotation  on pointclouds with correlation alignment</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[296]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02666</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Weishuang Zhang,  B Ravi Kiran,  Thomas Gauthier,  Yanis Mazouz,  Theo Steger</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：deployment vehicles using simulated data, unlabeled real pointcloud feature representations, costly human driven process, autonomous driving perception system, supervised object detection loss</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Annotating objects with 3D bounding boxes in LiDAR pointclouds is a costlyhuman driven process in an autonomous driving perception system.

Thanks to itsphysics-based structure, ensured by the use of a Galerkin projection of thefull order model (FOM) onto a linear low-dimensional subspace, RB methods yieldapproximations that fulfill the physical problem at hand. However, to make theassembling of a ROM independent of the FOM dimension, intrusive and expensivehyper-reduction stages are usually required, such as the discrete empiricalinterpolation method (DEIM), thus making this strategy less feasible forproblems characterized by (high-order polynomial or nonpolynomial)nonlinearities. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose a novel strategy forlearning nonlinear ROM operators using deep neural networks (DNNs).

In this paper, we focus on sparse training and highlight aperhaps counter-intuitive finding, that random pruning at initialization can bequite powerful for the sparse training of modern neural networks. Without anydelicate pruning criteria or carefully pursued sparsity structures, weempirically demonstrate that sparsely training a randomly pruned network fromscratch can match the performance of its dense equivalent. There are two keyfactors that contribute to this revival: (i) the network sizes matter: as theoriginal dense networks grow wider and deeper, the performance of training arandomly pruned sparse network will quickly grow to matching that of its denseequivalent, even at high sparsity ratios; (ii) appropriate layer-wise sparsityratios can be pre-chosen for sparse training, which shows to be anotherimportant performance booster. Simple as it looks, a randomly pruned subnetworkof Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely trained to outperforming a dense WideResNet-50, on ImageNet. We also observed such randomly pruned networksoutperform dense counterparts in other favorable aspects, such asout-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, and adversarialrobustness. Overall, our results strongly suggest there is larger-than-expectedroom for sparse training at scale, and the benefits of sparsity might be moreuniversal beyond carefully designed pruning.

Previously, an aggregation-based certified defense, DeepPartition Aggregation (DPA), was proposed to mitigate this threat. DPA predictsthrough an aggregation of base classifiers trained on disjoint subsets of data,thus restricting its sensitivity to dataset distortions. In this work, wepropose an improved certified defense against general poisoning attacks, namelyFinite Aggregation. In contrast to DPA, which directly splits the training setinto disjoint subsets, our method first splits the training set into smallerdisjoint subsets and then combines duplicates of them to build larger (but notdisjoint) subsets for training base classifiers. This reduces the worst-caseimpacts of poison samples and thus improves certified robustness bounds. Inaddition, we offer an alternative view of our method, bridging the designs ofdeterministic and stochastic aggregation-based certified defenses. Empirically,our proposed Finite Aggregation consistently improves certificates on MNIST,CIFAR-10, and GTSRB, boosting certified fractions by up to 3.05%, 3.87% and4.77%, respectively, while keeping the same clean accuracies as DPA's,effectively establishing a new state of the art in (pointwise) certifiedrobustness against data poisoning.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>126. <b>标题：Training Differentially Private Models with Secure Multiparty  Computation</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[317]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02625</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Sikha Pentyala,  Davis Railsback,  Ricardo Maia,  Rafael Dowsley,  David Melanson,  Anderson Nascimento,  Martine De Cock</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：dp approach achieves higher accuracy, providing formal privacy guarantees regarding, work obtained first place, idash2021 track iii competition, formal privacy guarantees</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>We address the problem of learning a machine learning model from trainingdata that originates at multiple data owners while providing formal privacyguarantees regarding the protection of each owner's data.

Ideally, a robustclassifier would be immune to small variations in input images, and a number ofdefensive approaches have been created as a result. One method would be todiscern a latent representation which could ignore small changes to the input.However, typical autoencoders easily mingle inter-class latent representationswhen there are strong similarities between classes, making it harder for adecoder to accurately project the image back to the original high-dimensionalspace. We propose a novel framework, Memory Defense, an augmented classifierwith a memory-masking autoencoder to counter this challenge. By masking otherclasses, the autoencoder learns class-specific independent latentrepresentations. We test the model's robustness against four widely usedattacks.

We extractedunique features (e.g., Fixation Count, Eye Movement Ratio) from the eye gazedata of 31 participants to generate a dataset containing 124 samples of visualintention for perceiving textual or graphical information, labeled as eitherTEXT or IMAGE, having 48.39% and 51.61% distribution, respectively. Using thisdataset, we analyzed 5 classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM)(Accuracy: 92.19%). Using the trained SVM, we investigated the variation ofvisual intention among 30 participants, distributed in 3 age groups, and foundout that young users were more leaned towards graphical contents whereas olderadults felt more interested in textual ones. This finding suggests thatreal-time eye gaze data can be a potential source of identifying visualintention, analyzing which intention aware interactive interfaces can bedesigned and developed to facilitate human cognition.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>132. <b>标题：Communication Efficient Federated Learning via Ordered ADMM in a Fully  Decentralized Setting</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[333]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02580</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yicheng Chen,  Rick S.

In this paper, a communication efficientalgorithm, called ordering-based alternating direction method of multipliers(OADMM) is devised in a general fully decentralized network setting where aworker can only exchange messages with neighbors. Compared to the classicalADMM, a key feature of OADMM is that transmissions are ordered among workers ateach iteration such that a worker with the most informative data broadcasts itslocal variable to neighbors first, and neighbors who have not transmitted yetcan update their local variables based on that received transmission. In OADMM,we prohibit workers from transmitting if their current local variables are notsufficiently different from their previously transmitted value. A variant ofOADMM, called SOADMM, is proposed where transmissions are ordered buttransmissions are never stopped for each node at each iteration. Numericalresults demonstrate that given a targeted accuracy, OADMM can significantlyreduce the number of communications compared to existing algorithms includingADMM. We also show numerically that SOADMM can accelerate convergence,resulting in communication savings compared to the classical ADMM.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>133. <b>标题：Causal Disentanglement for Semantics-Aware Intent Learning in  Recommendation</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[334]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02576</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Xiangmeng Wang,  Qian Li,  Dianer Yu,  Peng Cui,  Zhichao Wang,  Guandong Xu</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：aware representations via disentangling users true intents aware, causal relations underlying recommendation task, aware disentanglement learning called cadsi, traditional recommendation models trained, eliminate confounding bias stemmed</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Traditional recommendation models trained on observational interaction datahave generated large impacts in a wide range of applications, it faces biasproblems that cover users' true intent and thus deteriorate the recommendationeffectiveness. Existing methods tracks this problem as eliminating bias for therobust recommendation, e.g., by re-weighting training samples or learningdisentangled representation. The disentangled representation methods as thestate-of-the-art eliminate bias through revealing cause-effect of the biasgeneration. However, how to design the semantics-aware and unbiasedrepresentation for users true intents is largely unexplored. To bridge the gap,we are the first to propose an unbiased and semantics-aware disentanglementlearning called CaDSI (Causal Disentanglement for Semantics-Aware IntentLearning) from a causal perspective. Particularly, CaDSI explicitly models thecausal relations underlying recommendation task, and thus producessemantics-aware representations via disentangling users true intents aware ofspecific item context. Moreover, the causal intervention mechanism is designedto eliminate confounding bias stemmed from context information, which furtherto align the semantics-aware representation with users true intent. Extensiveexperiments and case studies both validate the robustness and interpretabilityof our proposed model.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>134. <b>标题：Differentially Private Graph Classification with GNNs</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[335]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02575</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Tamara T.

In this work, we reveal the vulnerability ofGNN to the imbalance of node labels. Traditional solutions for imbalancedclassification (e.g. resampling) are ineffective in node classification withoutconsidering the graph structure. Worse still, they may even bring overfittingor underfitting results due to lack of sufficient prior knowledge. To solvethese problems, we propose a novel graph neural network framework withcurriculum learning (GNN-CL) consisting of two modules. For one thing, we hopeto acquire certain reliable interpolation nodes and edges through the novelgraph-based oversampling based on smoothness and homophily. For another, wecombine graph classification loss and metric learning loss which adjust thedistance between different nodes associated with minority class in featurespace. Inspired by curriculum learning, we dynamically adjust the weights ofdifferent modules during training process to achieve better ability ofgeneralization and discrimination.

To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel score-basedgenerative model for graphs with a continuous-time framework.

In this paper, we first apply Shapley value (SV) from coalitiongame theory into the PFL scenario.

The WL distance is polynomial time computable and is also compatiblewith the WL test in the sense that the former is positive if and only if the WLtest can distinguish the two involved graphs.

In this paper, wedevise a Gradient Descent method with Sparsification and Error Correction(GD-SEC) to improve the communications efficiency in a general worker-serverarchitecture. Motivated by a variety of wireless communications learningscenarios, GD-SEC reduces the number of bits per communication from worker toserver with no degradation in the order of the convergence rate. This enableslarger-scale model learning without sacrificing convergence or accuracy. Ateach iteration of GD-SEC, instead of directly transmitting the entire gradientvector, each worker computes the difference between its current gradient and alinear combination of its previously transmitted gradients, and then transmitsthe sparsified gradient difference to the server. A key feature of GD-SEC isthat any given component of the gradient difference vector will not betransmitted if its magnitude is not sufficiently large. An error correctiontechnique is used at each worker to compensate for the error resulting fromsparsification. We prove that GD-SEC is guaranteed to converge for stronglyconvex, convex, and nonconvex optimization problems with the same order ofconvergence rate as GD. Furthermore, if the objective function is stronglyconvex, GD-SEC has a fast linear convergence rate. Numerical results not onlyvalidate the convergence rate of GD-SEC but also explore the communication bitsavings it provides.

Despite extensive research in recentyears, FSL is still not yet able to generate satisfactory solutions for a widerange of real-world applications. To confront this challenge, we study the FSLproblem from a geometric point of view in this paper. One observation is thatthe widely embraced ProtoNet model is essentially a Voronoi Diagram (VD) in thefeature space. We retrofit it by making use of a recent advance incomputational geometry called Cluster-induced Voronoi Diagram (CIVD). Startingfrom the simplest nearest neighbor model, CIVD gradually incorporatescluster-to-point and then cluster-to-cluster relationships for spacesubdivision, which is used to improve the accuracy and robustness at multiplestages of FSL. Specifically, we use CIVD (1) to integrate parametric andnonparametric few-shot classifiers; (2) to combine feature representation andsurrogate representation; (3) and to leverage feature-level,transformation-level, and geometry-level heterogeneities for a better ensemble.Our CIVD-based workflow enables us to achieve new state-of-the-art results onmini-ImageNet, CUB, and tiered-ImagenNet datasets, with ${\sim}2\%{-}5\%$improvements upon the next best. To summarize, CIVD provides a mathematicallyelegant and geometrically interpretable framework that compensates for extremedata insufficiency, prevents overfitting, and allows for fast geometricensemble for thousands of individual VD.

The key difference to existinginvariant models is that we design multiple context explorers (specified asgraph editers in our case) that are adversarially trained to maximize thevariance of risks from multiple virtual environments. Such a design enables themodel to extrapolate from a single observed environment which is the commoncase for node-level prediction. We prove the validity of our method bytheoretically showing its guarantee of a valid OOD solution and furtherdemonstrate its power on various real-world datasets for handling distributionshifts from artificial spurious features, cross-domain transfers and dynamicgraph evolution.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>151. <b>标题：ASHA: Assistive Teleoperation via Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement  Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[387]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02465</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Sean Chen,  Jensen Gao,  Siddharth Reddy,  Glen Berseth,  Anca D.

Reinforcement learning fromonline user feedback on the system's performance presents a natural solution tothis problem, and enables the interface to adapt to individual users. However,this approach tends to require a large amount of human-in-the-loop trainingdata, especially when feedback is sparse. We propose a hierarchical solutionthat learns efficiently from sparse user feedback: we use offline pre-trainingto acquire a latent embedding space of useful, high-level robot behaviors,which, in turn, enables the system to focus on using online user feedback tolearn a mapping from user inputs to desired high-level behaviors. The keyinsight is that access to a pre-trained policy enables the system to learn morefrom sparse rewards than a naïve RL algorithm: using the pre-trained policy,the system can make use of successful task executions to relabel, in hindsight,what the user actually meant to do during unsuccessful executions. We evaluateour method primarily through a user study with 12 participants who performtasks in three simulated robotic manipulation domains using a webcam and theireye gaze: flipping light switches, opening a shelf door to reach objectsinside, and rotating a valve. The results show that our method successfullylearns to map 128-dimensional gaze features to 7-dimensional joint torques fromsparse rewards in under 10 minutes of online training, and seamlessly helpsusers who employ different gaze strategies, while adapting to distributionalshift in webcam inputs, tasks, and environments.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>152. <b>标题：Application of Machine Learning-Based Pattern Recognition in IoT  Devices: Review</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[391]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02456</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Zachary Menter,  Wei Tee,  Rushit Dave</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：overall required processing power, different machine learning algorithms, based pattern recognition algorithms, optimal machine learning, pattern recognition algorithms</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The Internet of things (IoT) is a rapidly advancing area of technology thathas quickly become more widespread in recent years.

Althoughthese representations are easy to fit, it is not clear how to best evaluategeometric queries on the shape, such as intersecting against a ray or finding aclosest point. The predominant approach is to encourage the network to have asigned distance property. However, this property typically holds onlyapproximately, leading to robustness issues, and holds only at the conclusionof training, inhibiting the use of queries in loss functions. Instead, thiswork presents a new approach to perform queries directly on general neuralimplicit functions for a wide range of existing architectures. Our key tool isthe application of range analysis to neural networks, using automaticarithmetic rules to bound the output of a network over a region; we conduct astudy of range analysis on neural networks, and identify variants of affinearithmetic which are highly effective. We use the resulting bounds to developgeometric queries including ray casting, intersection testing, constructingspatial hierarchies, fast mesh extraction, closest-point evaluation, evaluatingbulk properties, and more.

The main idea behind currentapproaches to solving letter-string analogies is to design heuristic rules forextracting analogy structures and constructing analogy mappings. However, onekey problem is that it is difficult to build a comprehensive and exhaustive setof analogy structures which can fully describe the subtlety of analogies. Thisproblem makes current approaches unable to handle complicated letter-stringanalogy problems. In this paper, we propose Neural logic analogy learning(Noan), which is a dynamic neural architecture driven by differentiable logicreasoning to solve analogy problems. Each analogy problem is converted intological expressions consisting of logical variables and basic logicaloperations (AND, OR, and NOT). More specifically, Noan learns the logicalvariables as vector embeddings and learns each logical operation as a neuralmodule. In this way, the model builds computational graph integrating neuralnetwork with logical reasoning to capture the internal logical structure of theinput letter strings. The analogy learning problem then becomes a True/Falseevaluation problem of the logical expressions. Experiments show that ourmachine learning-based Noan approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches onstandard letter-string analogy benchmark datasets.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>161. <b>标题：On Neural Differential Equations</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[404]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02435</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Patrick Kidger</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Doctoral thesis, Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford. 231 pages</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：physical systems ); neural controlled differential equations, brownian reconstruction ); symbolic regression, many popular neural network architectures, via regularised evolution );, reversible differential equations solvers</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic ofgreat interest.

However, this static setting makes little sense formany real-world applications where data comes in continuously as a stream ofnew edges and nodes, and one has to update model predictions incrementally toreflect the latest state. To fully capitalize on the newly available data inthe stream, recent graph-based recommendation models would need to berepeatedly retrained, which is infeasible in practice.In this paper, we study the graph-based streaming recommendation setting andpropose a compositional recommendation model -- Lightweight CompositionalEmbedding (LCE) -- that supports incremental updates under low computationalcost. Instead of learning explicit embeddings for the full set of nodes, LCElearns explicit embeddings for only a subset of nodes and represents the othernodes {\em implicitly}, through a composition function based on theirinteractions in the graph. This provides an effective, yet efficient, means toleverage streaming graph data when one node type (e.g., items) is more amenableto static representation. We conduct an extensive empirical study to compareLCE to a set of competitive baselines on three large-scale user-itemrecommendation datasets with interactions under a streaming setting.

At everyjob arrival, a dispatcher decides to assign the job to an available server orto block it. Every served job yields a fixed reward for the dispatcher, but italso results in a cost per unit time of service. Our goal is to design adispatching policy that maximizes the long-term average reward for thedispatcher based on observing the arrival times and the state of the system ateach arrival; critically, the dispatcher observes neither the service times nordeparture times.We develop our learning-based dispatch scheme as a parametric learningproblem a'la self-tuning adaptive control. In our problem, certainty equivalentcontrol switches between an always admit policy (always explore) and a neveradmit policy (immediately terminate learning), which is distinct from theadaptive control literature. Our learning scheme then uses maximum likelihoodestimation followed by certainty equivalent control but with judicious use ofthe always admit policy so that learning doesn't stall.

However, a naive application ofBayesian methods in non-stationary environments leads to slow adaptation andresults in state estimates that may converge confidently to the wrong parametervalue. A common solution when learning in changing environments is todiscard/downweight past data; however, this simple mechanism of "forgetting"fails to account for the fact that many real-world environments involverevisiting similar states. We propose a new framework, Bayes with AdaptiveMemory (BAM), that takes advantage of past experience by allowing the agent tochoose which past observations to remember and which to forget. We demonstratethat BAM generalizes many popular Bayesian update rules for non-stationaryenvironments. Through a variety of experiments, we demonstrate the ability ofBAM to continuously adapt in an ever-changing world.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>171. <b>标题：Self-Adaptive Forecasting for Improved Deep Learning on Non-Stationary  Time-Series</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[420]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02403</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Sercan O.

SAFintegrates a self-adaptation stage prior to forecasting based on `backcasting',i.e. predicting masked inputs backward in time. This is a form of test-timetraining that creates a self-supervised learning problem on test samples beforeperforming the prediction task. In this way, our method enables efficientadaptation of encoded representations to evolving distributions, leading tosuperior generalization. SAF can be integrated with any canonicalencoder-decoder based time-series architecture such as recurrent neuralnetworks or attention-based architectures. On synthetic and real-world datasetsin domains where time-series data are known to be notoriously non-stationary,such as healthcare and finance, we demonstrate a significant benefit of SAF inimproving forecasting accuracy.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>172. <b>标题：A Temporal-Difference Approach to Policy Gradient Estimation</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[423]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02396</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Samuele Tosatto,  Andrew Patterson,  Martha White,  A.

In this paper, we propose a new approach of reconstructing thepolicy gradient from the start state without requiring a particular samplingstrategy. The policy gradient calculation in this form can be simplified interms of a gradient critic, which can be recursively estimated due to a newBellman equation of gradients.

Theapplications of such methods are vast and diverse, but most of the current workrelies on the assumption of a static graph. This assumption does not hold formany highly dynamic systems, where the underlying connectivity structure isnon-stationary and is mostly unobserved. Using a static model in thesesituations may result in sub-optimal performance. In contrast, modeling changesin graph structure with time can provide information about the system whoseapplications go beyond classification. Most work of this type does not learneffective connectivity and focuses on cross-correlation between nodes togenerate undirected graphs. An undirected graph is unable to capture directionof an interaction which is vital in many fields, including neuroscience. Tobridge this gap, we developed dynamic effective connectivity estimation vianeural network training (DECENNT), a novel model to learn an interpretabledirected and dynamic graph induced by the downstream classification/predictiontask. DECENNT outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on five differenttasks and infers interpretable task-specific dynamic graphs.

However, different featureimportance methods are likely to compute different feature importance rankseven for the same dataset and classifier. Hence such interchangeable use offeature importance methods can lead to conclusion instabilities unless there isa strong agreement among different methods. Therefore, in this paper, weevaluate the agreement between the feature importance ranks associated with thestudied classifiers through a case study of 18 software projects and sixcommonly used classifiers. We find that: 1) The computed feature importanceranks by CA and CS methods do not always strongly agree with each other. 2) Thecomputed feature importance ranks by the studied CA methods exhibit a strongagreement including the features reported at top-1 and top-3 ranks for a givendataset and classifier, while even the commonly used CS methods yield vastlydifferent feature importance ranks. Such findings raise concerns about thestability of conclusions across replicated studies. We further observe that thecommonly used defect datasets are rife with feature interactions and thesefeature interactions impact the computed feature importance ranks of the CSmethods (not the CA methods). We demonstrate that removing these featureinteractions, even with simple methods like CFS improves agreement between thecomputed feature importance ranks of CA and CS methods. In light of ourfindings, we provide guidelines for stakeholders and practitioners whenperforming model interpretation and directions for future research, e.g.,future research is needed to investigate the impact of advanced featureinteraction removal methods on computed feature importance ranks of differentCS methods.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>176. <b>标题：Marius++: Large-Scale Training of Graph Neural Networks on a Single  Machine</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[433]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02365</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Roger Waleffe,  Jason Mohoney,  Theodoros Rekatsinas,  Shivaram Venkataraman</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：deep graph library using seven benchmark, based training allows marius ++ deployments, based training exhibit accuracy similar, single machine outperforms resource, art models aggregate information</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful model for ML overgraph-structured data.

In this paper, we focus on scalabletraining of GNNs with emphasis on resource efficiency.

We evaluate Marius++ againstPyTorch Geometric and Deep Graph Library using seven benchmark (model, dataset) settings and find that Marius++ with one GPU can achieve the same level ofmodel accuracy up to 8$\times$ faster than these systems when they are using upto eight GPUs. For these experiments, disk-based training allows Marius++deployments to be up to 64$\times$ cheaper in monetary cost than those of thecompeting systems.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>177. <b>标题：A Discourse on MetODS: Meta-Optimized Dynamical Synapses for  Meta-Reinforcement Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[434]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02363</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Mathieu Chalvidal,  Thomas Serre,  Rufin VanRullen</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：computational mechanisms support flexible behavioral adaptation, robust reinforcement learning programs emerge spontaneously, leverages fast synaptic dynamics influenced, parameters governing metods synaptic processes, model learning powerful control rules</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Recent meta-reinforcement learning work has emphasized the importance ofmnemonic control for agents to quickly assimilate relevant experience in newcontexts and suitably adapt their policy.

To reduce PI latency wepropose a gradient-based algorithm that selectively linearizes ReLUs whilemaintaining prediction accuracy. We evaluate our algorithm on several standardPI benchmarks.

To remove theeffect of semantic noise, adversarial training is proposed to incorporate thesamples with semantic noise in the training dataset. Then, the maskedautoencoder is designed as the architecture of a robust semantic communicationsystem, where a portion of the input is masked. To further improve therobustness of semantic communication systems, we design a discrete codebookshared by the transmitter and the receiver for encoded feature representation.Thus, the transmitter simply needs to transmit the indices of these features inthe codebook. Simulation results show that our proposed method significantlyimproves the robustness of semantic communication systems against semanticnoise with significant reduction on the transmission overhead.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>188. <b>标题：Optimal Ratio for Data Splitting</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[455]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03326</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：V.

However, SVGD has been found to suffer from varianceunderestimation when the dimensionality of the target distribution is high.Recent developments have advocated projecting both the score function and thedata onto real lines to sidestep this issue, although this can severelyoverestimate the epistemic (model) uncertainty. In this work, we proposeGrassmann Stein variational gradient descent (GSVGD) as an alternativeapproach, which permits projections onto arbitrary dimensional subspaces.Compared with other variants of SVGD that rely on dimensionality reduction,GSVGD updates the projectors simultaneously for the score function and thedata, and the optimal projectors are determined through a coupledGrassmann-valued diffusion process which explores favourable subspaces. Bothour theoretical and experimental results suggest that GSVGD enjoys efficientstate-space exploration in high-dimensional problems that have an intrinsiclow-dimensional structure.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>190. <b>标题：Human Activity Recognition Using Tools of Convolutional Neural Networks:  A State of the Art Review, Data Sets, Challenges and Future Prospects</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[458]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03274</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Md.

Being non-stationary in nature, EEGs are better analysedby spectro temporal representations. Standard features like Discrete WaveletTransformation (DWT) can represent temporal changes in spectral dynamics of anEEG, but is insufficient to extract information other way around, i.e. spectralchanges in temporal dynamics. On the other hand, Empirical mode decomposition(EMD) based features can be useful to bridge the above mentioned gap. Towardsthis direction, we extract two novel features on top of EMD, namely, (a)marginal hilbert spectrum (MHS) and (b) Holo-Hilbert spectral analysis (HHSA)based on EMD, to better represent emotions in 2D arousal-valence (A-V) space.The usefulness of these features for EEG emotion classification is investigatedthrough extensive experiments using state-of-the-art classifiers.

In this paper, we investigate the use ofVariational Mode Decomposition and deep learning techniques to improve theaccuracy of the load forecasting problem. Although this problem has beenstudied in the literature, selecting an appropriate decomposition level and adeep learning technique providing better forecasting performance have garneredcomparatively less attention. This study bridges this gap by studying theeffect of six decomposition levels and five distinct deep learning networks.The raw load profiles are first decomposed into intrinsic mode functions usingthe Variational Mode Decomposition in order to mitigate their non-stationaryaspect. Then, day, hour, and past electricity consumption data are fed as athree-dimensional input sequence to a four-level Wavelet Decomposition Networkmodel. Finally, the forecast sequences related to the different intrinsic modefunctions are combined to form the aggregate forecast sequence. The proposedmethod was assessed using load profiles of five Moroccan households from theMoroccan buildings' electricity consumption dataset (MORED) and was benchmarkedagainst state-of-the-art time-series models and a baseline persistence model.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>194. <b>标题：A Variational Edge Partition Model for Supervised Graph Representation  Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[465]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03233</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yilin He,  Chaojie Wang,  Hao Zhang,  Bo Chen,  Mingyuan Zhou</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：14 pages, 3 figures, 13 pages of appendix</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：gnn based inference network, variational inference framework, gnn based predictor, supervised feature extraction, learning discriminative representations</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Graph neural networks (GNNs), which propagate the node features through theedges and learn how to transform the aggregated features under labelsupervision, have achieved great success in supervised feature extraction forboth node-level and graph-level classification tasks.

For many segmentation problems, however,data with pixel- or voxel-level labeling accuracy are scarce due to the cost ofmanual labeling. This problem is exacerbated in domains where manual annotationis difficult, resulting in large amounts of variability in the labeling evenacross domain experts. Therefore, training segmentation networks to generalizebetter by learning from both labeled and unlabeled images (calledsemi-supervised learning) is problem of both practical and theoreticalinterest. However, traditional semi-supervised learning methods forsegmentation often necessitate hand-crafting a differentiable regularizerspecific to a given segmentation problem, which can be extremelytime-consuming. In this work, we propose "supervision by denoising" (SUD), aframework that enables us to supervise segmentation models using their denoisedoutput as targets. SUD unifies temporal ensembling and spatial denoisingtechniques under a spatio-temporal denoising framework and alternates denoisingand network weight update in an optimization framework for semi-supervision. Wevalidate SUD on three tasks-kidney and tumor (3D), and brain (3D) segmentation,and cortical parcellation (2D)-demonstrating a significant improvement in theDice overlap and the Hausdorff distance of segmentations over supervised-onlyand temporal ensemble baselines.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>206. <b>标题：Learning fair representation with a parametric integral probability  metric</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[487]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02943</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Dongha Kim,  Kunwoong Kim,  Insung Kong,  Ilsang Ohn,  Yongdai Kim</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：24 pages, including references and appendix</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：generative adversarial network type algorithms, new adversarial training scheme, lfr ), whose goal, done heuristically without justification, adversarial training scheme</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>As they have a vital effect on social decision-making, AI algorithms shouldbe not only accurate but also fair. Among various algorithms for fairness AI,learning fair representation (LFR), whose goal is to find a fair representationwith respect to sensitive variables such as gender and race, has received muchattention. For LFR, the adversarial training scheme is popularly employed as isdone in the generative adversarial network type algorithms. The choice of adiscriminator, however, is done heuristically without justification. In thispaper, we propose a new adversarial training scheme for LFR, where the integralprobability metric (IPM) with a specific parametric family of discriminators isused. The most notable result of the proposed LFR algorithm is its theoreticalguarantee about the fairness of the final prediction model, which has not beenconsidered yet.

This method utilizes a hard-thresholding pursuit-based algorithmapplied to the sparse ridge regression (SRR) problem to approximate thecoefficients with respect to the random feature matrix. The SRR formulationbalances between obtaining sparse models that use fewer terms in theirrepresentation and ridge-based smoothing that tend to be robust to noise andoutliers.

The mainstream DL methodology for the MI-EEG classification exploits thetemporospatial patterns of EEG signals using convolutional neural networks(CNNs), which have been particularly successful in visual images. However,since the statistical characteristics of visual images may not benefit EEGsignals, a natural question that arises is whether there exists an alternativenetwork architecture despite CNNs to extract features for the MI-EEGclassification. To address this question, we propose a novel geometric deeplearning (GDL) framework called Tensor-CSPNet to characterize EEG signals onsymmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds and exploit thetemporo-spatio-frequential patterns using deep neural networks on SPDmanifolds. Meanwhile, many experiences of successful MI-EEG classifiers havebeen integrated into the Tensor-CSPNet framework to make it more efficient. Inthe experiments, Tensor-CSPNet attains or slightly outperforms the currentstate-of-the-art performance on the cross-validation and holdout scenarios oftwo MI-EEG datasets. The visualization and interpretability analyses alsoexhibit its validity for the MI-EEG classification. To conclude, we provide afeasible answer to the question by generalizing the previous DL methodologieson SPD manifolds, which indicates the start of a specific class from the GDLmethodology for the MI-EEG classification.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>223. <b>标题：One-Nearest-Neighbor Search is All You Need for Minimax Optimal  Regression and Classification</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[529]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02464</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：J.

In this paper, we introduce the functional assessment(FA) of retinal models, which describes the concept of evaluating theperformance of retinal models on visual understanding tasks. We present amachine learning method for FA: we feed traditional machine learningclassifiers with RGC responses generated by retinal models, to solve object anddigit recognition tasks (CIFAR-10, MNIST, Fashion MNIST, Imagenette). Weexamined critical FA aspects, including how the performance of FA depends onthe task, how to optimally feed RGC responses to the classifiers and how thenumber of output neurons correlates with the model's accuracy. To increase thenumber of output neurons, we manipulated input images - by splitting and thenfeeding them to the retinal model and we found that image splitting does notsignificantly improve the model's accuracy. We also show that differences inthe structure of datasets result in largely divergent performance of theretinal model (MNIST and Fashion MNIST exceeded 80% accuracy, while CIFAR-10and Imagenette achieved ~40%). Furthermore, retinal models which perform betterin standard evaluation, i.e. more accurately predict RGC response, performbetter in FA as well. However, unlike standard evaluation, FA results can bestraightforwardly interpreted in the context of comparing the quality of visualperception.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>225. <b>标题：Stratification of carotid atheromatous plaque using interpretable deep  learning methods on B-mode ultrasound images</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[532]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02428</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Theofanis Ganitidis,  Maria Athanasiou,  Kalliopi Dalakleidi,  Nikos Melanitis,  Spyretta Golemati,  Konstantina S Nikita</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Accepted at 2021 43rd Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society (EMBC)</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：proposed approach achieved acceptable discrimination performance, auc ): 73 %, sensitivity, two fully connected layers, novel ultrasound image biomarkers, ensemble learning scheme based</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Carotid atherosclerosis is the major cause of ischemic stroke resulting insignificant rates of mortality and disability annually. Early diagnosis of suchcases is of great importance, since it enables clinicians to apply a moreeffective treatment strategy. This paper introduces an interpretableclassification approach of carotid ultrasound images for the risk assessmentand stratification of patients with carotid atheromatous plaque. To address thehighly imbalanced distribution of patients between the symptomatic andasymptomatic classes (16 vs 58, respectively), an ensemble learning schemebased on a sub-sampling approach was applied along with a two-phase,cost-sensitive strategy of learning, that uses the original and a resampleddata set. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were utilized for building theprimary models of the ensemble. A six-layer deep CNN was used to automaticallyextract features from the images, followed by a classification stage of twofully connected layers.

The main challenge of logistic bandits is reducing the dependence on apotentially large problem dependent constant $\kappa$ that can at worst scaleexponentially with the norm of the unknown parameter $\theta_{\ast}$. Abeilleet al. (2021) have applied self-concordance of the logistic function to removethis worst-case dependence providing regret guarantees like$O(d\log^2(\kappa)\sqrt{\dot\mu T}\log(|\mathcal{X}|))$ where $d$ is thedimensionality, $T$ is the time horizon, and $\dot\mu$ is the variance of thebest-arm. This work improves upon this bound in the fixed arm setting byemploying an experimental design procedure that achieves a minimax regret of$O(\sqrt{d \dot\mu T\log(|\mathcal{X}|)})$. Our regret bound in fact takes atighter instance (i.e., gap) dependent regret bound for the first time inlogistic bandits. We also propose a new warmup sampling algorithm that candramatically reduce the lower order term in the regret in general and provethat it can replace the lower order term dependency on $\kappa$ to$\log^2(\kappa)$ for some instances. Finally, we discuss the impact of the biasof the MLE on the logistic bandit problem, providing an example where $d^2$lower order regret (cf., it is $d$ for linear bandits) may not be improved aslong as the MLE is used and how bias-corrected estimators may be used to makeit closer to $d$.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>228. <b>标题：Bregman Plug-and-Play Priors</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[535]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02388</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Abdullah H.

We combine mid-infrared cavity-enhanceddirect frequency comb spectroscopy (CE-DFCS), capable of real-time collectionof tens of thousands of distinct molecular features at parts-per-trillionsensitivity, with supervised machine learning, capable of analysis andverification of extremely high-dimensional input data channels. Here, wepresent the first application of this method to the breath detection ofCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Using 170 individual samples at theUniversity of Colorado, we report a cross-validated area under theReceiver-Operating-Characteristics curve of 0.849(4), providing excellentprediction performance. Further, this method detected a significant differencebetween male and female breath as well as other variables such as smoking andabdominal pain. Together, these highlight the utility of CE-DFCS for rapid,non-invasive detection of diverse biological conditions and disease states.

CIM uses an auxiliary generator with a small trainable BEiT tocorrupt the input image instead of using artificial mask tokens, where somepatches are randomly selected and replaced with plausible alternatives sampledfrom the BEiT output distribution. Given this corrupted image, an enhancernetwork learns to either recover all the original image pixels, or predictwhether each visual token is replaced by a generator sample or not. Thegenerator and the enhancer are simultaneously trained and synergisticallyupdated. After pre-training, the enhancer can be used as a high-capacity visualencoder for downstream tasks. CIM is a general and flexible visual pre-trainingframework that is suitable for various network architectures. For the firsttime, CIM demonstrates that both ViT and CNN can learn rich visualrepresentations using a unified, non-Siamese framework. Experimental resultsshow that our approach achieves compelling results in vision benchmarks, suchas ImageNet classification and ADE20K semantic segmentation.

Recent methods use auxiliary outlier data to regularizethe model for improved OOD detection. However, these approaches make a strongdistributional assumption that the auxiliary outlier data is completelyseparable from the in-distribution (ID) data. In this paper, we propose a novelframework that leverages wild mixture data -- that naturally consists of bothID and OOD samples.

Prior work identifies harmful behaviorsbefore deployment by using human annotators to hand-write test cases. However,human annotation is expensive, limiting the number and diversity of test cases.In this work, we automatically find cases where a target LM behaves in aharmful way, by generating test cases ("red teaming") using another LM. Weevaluate the target LM's replies to generated test questions using a classifiertrained to detect offensive content, uncovering tens of thousands of offensivereplies in a 280B parameter LM chatbot. We explore several methods, fromzero-shot generation to reinforcement learning, for generating test cases withvarying levels of diversity and difficulty. Furthermore, we use promptengineering to control LM-generated test cases to uncover a variety of otherharms, automatically finding groups of people that the chatbot discusses inoffensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot'sown contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harmsthat occur over the course of a conversation. Overall, LM-based red teaming isone promising tool (among many needed) for finding and fixing diverse,undesirable LM behaviors before impacting users.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>7. <b>标题：Personalized Public Policy Analysis in Social Sciences using  Causal-Graphical Normalizing Flows</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[49]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03281</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Sourabh Balgi,  Jose M.

Traditional causal effect estimation methods suchas Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) and more recentlyRegression-With-Residuals (RWR) are widely used - as they avoid the challengingtask of identifying the SCM parameters - to estimate ATE and CATE. However,much work remains before traditional estimation methods can be used forcounterfactual inference, and for the benefit of Personalized Public PolicyAnalysis (P$^3$A) in the social sciences. While doctors rely on personalizedmedicine to tailor treatments to patients in laboratory settings (relativelyclosed systems), P$^3$A draws inspiration from such tailoring but adapts it foropen social systems. In this article, we develop a method for counterfactualinference that we name causal-Graphical Normalizing Flow (c-GNF), facilitatingP$^3$A. First, we show how c-GNF captures the underlying SCM without making anyassumption about functional forms. Second, we propose a novel dequantizationtrick to deal with discrete variables, which is a limitation of normalizingflows in general. Third, we demonstrate in experiments that c-GNF performson-par with IPW and RWR in terms of bias and variance for estimating the ATE,when the true functional forms are known, and better when they are unknown.Fourth and most importantly, we conduct counterfactual inference with c-GNFs,demonstrating promising empirical performance. Because IPW and RWR, like othertraditional methods, lack the capability of counterfactual inference, c-GNFswill likely play a major role in tailoring personalized treatment, facilitatingP$^3$A, optimizing social interventions - in contrast to the current`one-size-fits-all' approach of existing methods.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>8. <b>标题：AI-based artistic representation of emotions from EEG signals: a  discussion on fairness, inclusion, and aesthetics</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[60]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03246</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Piera Riccio,  Kristin Bergaust,  Boel Christensen-Scheel,  Juan-Carlos De Martin,  Maria A.

One drawback of the proposedarchitectures, which are often based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN), is thatthey cannot generalize across the size of the output space from which variablesare assigned a value, for example, set of colors in a GCP, or board-size insudoku. We call the output space for the variables as 'value-set'. While manyworks have demonstrated generalization of GNNs across graph size, there hasbeen no study on how to design a GNN for achieving value-set invariance forproblems that come from the same domain. For example, learning to solve 16 x 16sudoku after being trained on only 9 x 9 sudokus. In this work, we proposenovel methods to extend GNN based architectures to achieve value-setinvariance. Specifically, our model builds on recently proposed RecurrentRelational Networks. Our first approach exploits the graph-size invariance ofGNNs by converting a multi-class node classification problem into a binary nodeclassification problem. Our second approach works directly with multipleclasses by adding multiple nodes corresponding to the values in the value-set,and then connecting variable nodes to value nodes depending on the probleminitialization. Our experimental evaluation on three different combinatorialproblems demonstrates that both our models perform well on our novel problem,compared to a generic neural reasoner. Between two of our models, we observe aninherent trade-off: while the binarized model gives better performance whentrained on smaller value-sets, multi-valued model is much more memoryefficient, resulting in improved performance when trained on larger value-sets,where binarized model fails to train.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>10. <b>标题：AI Research Associate for Early-Stage Scientific Discovery</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[78]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03199</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Morad Behandish,  John Maxwell III,  Johan de Kleer</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Paper #203</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：even dogmatized ), stifling transformative discoveries, g ., postulated forms, stage scientific discovery based, g ., constitutive, real problems faced</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has been increasingly applied in scientificactivities for decades; however, it is still far from an insightful andtrustworthy collaborator in the scientific process.

Wepresent AP-mMIMO, a new method that jointly eliminates the multiuserinterference and compensates the severe nonlinear (NL) PA distortions. Unlikeprevious works, AP-mMIMO has a low computational complexity, making it suitablefor a global energy-efficient system. Specifically, we aim to design thePA-aware precoder and the receive decoder by leveraging the concept ofautoprecoder, whereas the end-to-end massive multiuser (MU)-MIMO downlink isdesigned using a deep neural network (NN). Most importantly, the proposedAP-mMIMO is suited for the varying block fading channel scenario. To deal withsuch scenarios, we consider a two-stage precoding scheme: 1) a NN-precoder isused to address the PA non-linearities and 2) a linear precoder is used tosuppress the multiuser interference. The NN-precoder and the receive decoderare trained off-line and when the channel varies, only the linear precoderchanges on-line.

AI techniques are numerous with many approaches andvariants, but they can be classified simply based on the degree of knowledgethey capture and how much data they require; two broad categories emerge asprominent across AI to date: (1) techniques that are primarily, and oftensolely, data-driven while leveraging little to no knowledge and (2) techniquesthat primarily leverage knowledge and depend less on data. Now, a thirdcategory is starting to emerge that leverages both data and knowledge, thatsome refer to as "informed AI." This third category can be a game changerwithin the national security domain where there is ample scientific anddomain-specific knowledge that stands ready to be leveraged, and where purelydata-driven AI can lead to serious unwanted consequences.This report shares findings from a thorough exploration of AI approaches thatexploit data as well as principled and/or practical knowledge, which we referto as "knowledge-integrated informed AI." Specifically, we review illuminatingexamples of knowledge integrated in deep learning and reinforcement learningpipelines, taking note of the performance gains they provide. We also discussan apparent trade space across variants of knowledge-integrated informed AI,along with observed and prominent issues that suggest worthwhile futureresearch directions. Most importantly, this report suggests how the advantagesof knowledge-integrated informed AI stand to benefit the national securitydomain.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>15. <b>标题：TransFollower: Long-Sequence Car-Following Trajectory Prediction through  Transformer</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[88]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03183</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Meixin Zhu,  Simon S.

Thecorresponding car-following models, which describe how one vehicle followsanother vehicle in the traffic flow, form the cornerstone for microscopictraffic simulation and intelligent vehicle development. One major motivation ofcar-following models is to replicate human drivers' longitudinal drivingtrajectories. To model the long-term dependency of future actions on historicaldriving situations, we developed a long-sequence car-following trajectoryprediction model based on the attention-based Transformer model. The modelfollows a general format of encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder takeshistorical speed and spacing data as inputs and forms a mixed representation ofhistorical driving context using multi-head self-attention. The decoder takesthe future LV speed profile as input and outputs the predicted future FV speedprofile in a generative way (instead of an auto-regressive way, avoidingcompounding errors). Through cross-attention between encoder and decoder, thedecoder learns to build a connection between historical driving and future LVspeed, based on which a prediction of future FV speed can be obtained. We trainand test our model with 112,597 real-world car-following events extracted fromthe Shanghai Naturalistic Driving Study (SH-NDS). Results show that the modeloutperforms the traditional intelligent driver model (IDM), a fully connectedneural network model, and a long short-term memory (LSTM) based model in termsof long-sequence trajectory prediction accuracy. We also visualized theself-attention and cross-attention heatmaps to explain how the model derivesits predictions.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>16. <b>标题：Towards Loosely-Coupling Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Ontology-based  Reasoning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[92]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03173</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Zoi Kaoudi,  Abelardo Carlos Martinez Lorenzo,  Volker Markl</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：g ., owl2 )., .~ link prediction ),, vanilla knowledge graph embeddings, input knowledge graph contains, combine knowledge graph embeddings</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Knowledge graph completion (a.k.a.~link prediction), i.e.,~the task ofinferring missing information from knowledge graphs, is a widely used task inmany applications, such as product recommendation and question answering. Thestate-of-the-art approaches of knowledge graph embeddings and/or rule miningand reasoning are data-driven and, thus, solely based on the information theinput knowledge graph contains. This leads to unsatisfactory prediction resultswhich make such solutions inapplicable to crucial domains such as healthcare.To further enhance the accuracy of knowledge graph completion we propose toloosely-couple the data-driven power of knowledge graph embeddings withdomain-specific reasoning stemming from experts or entailment regimes (e.g.,OWL2). In this way, we not only enhance the prediction accuracy with domainknowledge that may not be included in the input knowledge graph but also allowusers to plugin their own knowledge graph embedding and reasoning method. Ourinitial results show that we enhance the MRR accuracy of vanilla knowledgegraph embeddings by up to 3x and outperform hybrid solutions that combineknowledge graph embeddings with rule mining and reasoning up to 3.5x MRR.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>17. <b>标题：The 6-Ds of Creating AI-Enabled Systems</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[93]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03172</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：John Piorkowski</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：precision medicine use case, ineffective approaches towards navigating, previous ai hype cycles, identify potential ai solutions, current artificial intelligence</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>We are entering our tenth year of the current Artificial Intelligence (AI)spring, and, as with previous AI hype cycles, the threat of an AI winter looms.AI winters occurred because of ineffective approaches towards navigating thetechnology valley of death.

In this paper, we propose CITRIS, a variational autoencoderframework that learns causal representations from temporal sequences of imagesin which underlying causal factors have possibly been intervened upon. Incontrast to the recent literature, CITRIS exploits temporality and observingintervention targets to identify scalar and multidimensional causal factors,such as 3D rotation angles. Furthermore, by introducing a normalizing flow,CITRIS can be easily extended to leverage and disentangle representationsobtained by already pretrained autoencoders. Extending previous results onscalar causal factors, we prove identifiability in a more general setting, inwhich only some components of a causal factor are affected by interventions. Inexperiments on 3D rendered image sequences, CITRIS outperforms previous methodson recovering the underlying causal variables. Moreover, using pretrainedautoencoders, CITRIS can even generalize to unseen instantiations of causalfactors, opening future research areas in sim-to-real generalization for causalrepresentation learning.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>19. <b>标题：Conversational Agents: Theory and Applications</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[96]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03164</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Mattias Wahde,  Marco Virgolin</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：preprint of a chapter to appear in Handbook of Computer Learning and Intelligence - Volume 1</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：cas ), discussing chatbots, potential risks regarding, many different approaches, future ca technology, briefly reviewing aspects</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>In this chapter, we provide a review of conversational agents (CAs),discussing chatbots, intended for casual conversation with a user, as well astask-oriented agents that generally engage in discussions intended to reach oneor several specific goals, often (but not always) within a specific domain.

And that's what distinguishes it from AI. Any successful AIimplementations (playing chess, unmanned driving, face recognition etc.) do notoperate with the meanings of the processed objects in any way and do notrecognize the meaning. And they don't need to. But for AGI, which emulateshuman thinking, this ability is crucial. Numerous attempts to define theconcept of "meaning" have one very significant drawback - all such definitionsare not strict and formalized, so they cannot be programmed. The meaning searchprocedure should use a formalized description of its existence and possibleforms of its perception. For the practical implementation of AGI, it isnecessary to develop such "ready-to-code" descriptions in the context of theiruse for processing the related cognitive concepts of "meaning" and "knowledge".An attempt to formalize the definition of such concepts is made in thisarticle.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>21. <b>标题：Approaches to Artificial General Intelligence: An Analysis</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[100]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03153</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Soumil Rathi</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：including human brain emulation, human brain emulation, human brain emulation, require scanning technologies, integrated cognitive architectures</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>This paper is an analysis of the different methods proposed to achieve AGI,including Human Brain Emulation, AIXI and Integrated Cognitive Architecture.First, the definition of AGI as used in this paper has been defined, and itsrequirements have been stated. For each proposed method mentioned, the methodin question was summarized and its key processes were detailed, showcasing howit functioned. Then, each method listed was analyzed, taking various factorsinto consideration, such as technological requirements, computational ability,and adequacy to the requirements. It was concluded that while there are variousmethods to achieve AGI that could work, such as Human Brain Emulation andIntegrated Cognitive Architectures, the most promising method to achieve AGI isIntegrated Cognitive Architectures. This is because Human Brain Emulation wasfound to require scanning technologies that will most likely not be availableuntil the 2030s, making it unlikely to be created before then. Moreover,Integrated Cognitive Architectures has reduced computational requirements and asuitable functionality for General Intelligence, making it the most likely wayto achieve AGI.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>22. <b>标题：OPP-Miner: Order-preserving sequential pattern mining</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[106]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03140</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Youxi Wu,  Qian Hu,  Yan Li,  Lei Guo,  Xingquan Zhu,  Xindong Wu</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：existing methods often convert time series data, existing methods mainly neglect, uses pattern fusion strategy, also discover similar sub, time series data</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>A time series is a collection of measurements in chronological order.Discovering patterns from time series is useful in many domains, such as stockanalysis, disease detection, and weather forecast. To discover patterns,existing methods often convert time series data into another form, such asnominal/symbolic format, to reduce dimensionality, which inevitably deviatesthe data values. Moreover, existing methods mainly neglect the orderrelationships between time series values. To tackle these issues, inspired byorder-preserving matching, this paper proposes an Order-Preserving sequentialPattern (OPP) mining method, which represents patterns based on the orderrelationships of the time series data. An inherent advantage of suchrepresentation is that the trend of a time series can be represented by therelative order of the values underneath the time series data. To obtainfrequent trends in time series, we propose the OPP-Miner algorithm to minepatterns with the same trend (sub-sequences with the same relative order).OPP-Miner employs the filtration and verification strategies to calculate thesupport and uses pattern fusion strategy to generate candidate patterns. Tocompress the result set, we also study finding the maximal OPPs. Experimentsvalidate that OPP-Miner is not only efficient and scalable but can alsodiscover similar sub-sequences in time series. In addition, case studies showthat our algorithms have high utility in analyzing the COVID-19 epidemic byidentifying critical trends and improve the clustering performance.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>23. <b>标题：Transformers in Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation with Unknown  Camera Intrinsics</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[109]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03131</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Arnav Varma,  Hemang Chawla,  Bahram Zonooz,  Elahe Arani</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Published in 17th International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAP, 2022)</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：advanced driver assistance systems necessitates continuous developments, kitti depth prediction benchmarks, supervised monocular depth estimation, supervised monocular depth estimation, supervised monocular depth estimation</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The advent of autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systemsnecessitates continuous developments in computer vision for 3D sceneunderstanding. Self-supervised monocular depth estimation, a method forpixel-wise distance estimation of objects from a single camera without the useof ground truth labels, is an important task in 3D scene understanding.However, existing methods for this task are limited to convolutional neuralnetwork (CNN) architectures. In contrast with CNNs that use localized linearoperations and lose feature resolution across the layers, vision transformersprocess at constant resolution with a global receptive field at every stage.While recent works have compared transformers against their CNN counterpartsfor tasks such as image classification, no study exists that investigates theimpact of using transformers for self-supervised monocular depth estimation.Here, we first demonstrate how to adapt vision transformers for self-supervisedmonocular depth estimation. Thereafter, we compare the transformer andCNN-based architectures for their performance on KITTI depth predictionbenchmarks, as well as their robustness to natural corruptions and adversarialattacks, including when the camera intrinsics are unknown. Our studydemonstrates how transformer-based architecture, though lower in run-timeefficiency, achieves comparable performance while being more robust andgeneralizable.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>24. <b>标题：Combining Deep Learning and Reasoning for Address Detection in  Unstructured Text Documents</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[116]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03103</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Matthias Engelbach,  Dennis Klau,  Jens Drawehn,  Maximilien Kintz</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：5 pages, 1 figure, submitted to AAAI-22 workshop CLeaR, peer reviewed</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：containing text using domain knowledge represented, sender address would boost many companies, visual deep learning model, crucial document information like, possible address regions</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Extracting information from unstructured text documents is a demanding task,since these documents can have a broad variety of different layouts and anon-trivial reading order, like it is the case for multi-column documents ornested tables.

However,it usually requires training each pairwise combination of tasks together inorder to capture task relationships, at an extremely high computational cost.In this work, we learn task relationships via an automated weighting framework,named Auto-Lambda. Unlike previous methods where task relationships are assumedto be fixed, Auto-Lambda is a gradient-based meta learning framework whichexplores continuous, dynamic task relationships via task-specific weightings,and can optimise any choice of combination of tasks through the formulation ofa meta-loss; where the validation loss automatically influences task weightingsthroughout training. We apply the proposed framework to both multi-task andauxiliary learning problems in computer vision and robotics, and show thatAuto-Lambda achieves state-of-the-art performance, even when compared tooptimisation strategies designed specifically for each problem and data domain.Finally, we observe that Auto-Lambda can discover interesting learningbehaviors, leading to new insights in multi-task learning.

The methods for measuring human stress responses could includesubjective questionnaires (developed by psychologists) and objective markersobserved using data from wearable and non-wearable sensors. In particular,wearable sensor-based methods commonly use data from electroencephalography,electrocardiogram, galvanic skin response, electromyography, electrodermalactivity, heart rate, heart rate variability, and photoplethysmography bothindividually and in multimodal fusion strategies. Whereas, methods based onnon-wearable sensors include strategies such as analyzing pupil dilation andspeech, smartphone data, eye movement, body posture, and thermal imaging.Whenever a stressful situation is encountered by an individual, physiological,physical, or behavioral changes are induced which help in coping with thechallenge at hand. A wide range of studies has attempted to establish arelationship between these stressful situations and the response of humanbeings by using different kinds of psychological, physiological, physical, andbehavioral measures. Inspired by the lack of availability of a definitiveverdict about the relationship of human stress with these different kinds ofmarkers, a detailed survey about human stress detection methods is conducted inthis paper. In particular, we explore how stress detection methods can benefitfrom artificial intelligence utilizing relevant data from various sources.

Predictivelearning and contrastive learning are the two most prevalent approaches forgraph self-supervised learning. However, they have their own drawbacks. Whilethe predictive learning methods can learn the contextual relationships betweenneighboring nodes and edges, they cannot learn global graph-level similarities.Contrastive learning, while it can learn global graph-level similarities, itsobjective to maximize the similarity between two differently perturbed graphsmay result in representations that cannot discriminate two similar graphs withdifferent properties. To tackle such limitations, we propose a framework thataims to learn the exact discrepancy between the original and the perturbedgraphs, coined as Discrepancy-based Self-supervised LeArning (D-SLA).Specifically, we create multiple perturbations of the given graph with varyingdegrees of similarity and train the model to predict whether each graph is theoriginal graph or a perturbed one. Moreover, we further aim to accuratelycapture the amount of discrepancy for each perturbed graph using the graph editdistance. We validate our method on various graph-related downstream tasks,including molecular property prediction, protein function prediction, and linkprediction tasks, on which our model largely outperforms relevant baselines.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>33. <b>标题：Measuring and Reducing Model Update Regression in Structured Prediction  for NLP</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[168]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02976</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Deng Cai,  Elman Mansimov,  Yi-An Lai,  Yixuan Su,  Lei Shu,  Yi Zhang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：reducing model update regression including model ensemble, work studies model update regression, better mitigate model update regression, machine learning based nlp models, analyze model update regression</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Recent advance in deep learning has led to rapid adoption of machine learningbased NLP models in a wide range of applications. Despite the continuous gainin accuracy, backward compatibility is also an important aspect for industrialapplications, yet it received little research attention. Backward compatibilityrequires that the new model does not regress on cases that were correctlyhandled by its predecessor. This work studies model update regression instructured prediction tasks. We choose syntactic dependency parsing andconversational semantic parsing as representative examples of structuredprediction tasks in NLP. First, we measure and analyze model update regressionin different model update settings. Next, we explore and benchmark existingtechniques for reducing model update regression including model ensemble andknowledge distillation.

In real-worldapplications, e.g., healthcare applications, the data collected by a singleorganization (e.g., hospital) is often limited, and the majority of massive anddiverse data is often segregated across multiple organizations. As such, itmotivates the researchers to conduct distributed deep learning, where the datauser would like to build DL models using the data segregated across multipledifferent data owners. However, this could lead to severe privacy concerns dueto the sensitive nature of the data, thus the data owners would be hesitant andreluctant to participate. We propose LDP-DL, a privacy-preserving distributeddeep learning framework via local differential privacy and knowledgedistillation, where each data owner learns a teacher model using its own(local) private dataset, and the data user learns a student model to mimic theoutput of the ensemble of the teacher models. In the experimental evaluation, acomprehensive comparison has been made among our proposed approach (i.e.,LDP-DL), DP-SGD, PATE and DP-FL, using three popular deep learning benchmarkdatasets (i.e., CIFAR10, MNIST and FashionMNIST). The experimental results showthat LDP-DL consistently outperforms the other competitors in terms of privacybudget and model accuracy.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>35. <b>标题：Jury Learning: Integrating Dissenting Voices into Machine Learning  Models</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[180]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02950</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Mitchell L.

ForML tasks ranging from online comment toxicity to misinformation detection tomedical diagnosis, different groups in society may have irreconcilabledisagreements about ground truth labels. Supervised ML today resolves theselabel disagreements implicitly using majority vote, which overrides minoritygroups' labels. We introduce jury learning, a supervised ML approach thatresolves these disagreements explicitly through the metaphor of a jury:defining which people or groups, in what proportion, determine the classifier'sprediction. For example, a jury learning model for online toxicity mightcentrally feature women and Black jurors, who are commonly targets of onlineharassment. To enable jury learning, we contribute a deep learning architecturethat models every annotator in a dataset, samples from annotators' models topopulate the jury, then runs inference to classify. Our architecture enablesjuries that dynamically adapt their composition, explore counterfactuals, andvisualize dissent.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>36. <b>标题：Parallel Successive Learning for Dynamic Distributed Model Training over  Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[182]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02947</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Seyyedali Hosseinalipour,  Su Wang,  Nicolo Michelusi,  Vaneet Aggarwal,  Christopher G.

For example, proteinstructures can shift, namely protein folding, between several conformations invarious biological processes. To enable PTPMs to produce task-awarerepresentations, we propose to learn interpretable, pluggable and extensibleprotein prompts as a way of injecting task-related knowledge into PTPMs. Inthis regard, prior PTPM optimization with the masked language modeling task canbe interpreted as learning a sequence prompt (Seq prompt) that enables PTPMs tocapture the sequential dependency between amino acids. To incorporateconformational knowledge to PTPMs, we propose an interaction-conformationprompt (IC prompt) that is learned through back-propagation with theprotein-protein interaction task.

However, it is unclear how to acquire newskills when objectives and constraints are in conflict with previously learnedskills. Moreover, when retraining, there is an intrinsic conflict betweenexploiting what has already been learned and exploring new skills. In softactor-critic (SAC) methods, a temperature parameter can be dynamically adjustedto weight the action entropy and balance the explore $\times$ exploittrade-off. However, controlling a single coefficient can be challenging withinthe context of retraining, even more so when goals are contradictory. In thiswork, inspired by neuroscience research, we propose a novel approach usinginhibitory networks to allow separate and adaptive state value evaluations, aswell as distinct automatic entropy tuning. Ultimately, our approach allows forcontrolling inhibition to handle conflict between exploiting less risky,acquired behaviors and exploring novel ones to overcome more challenging tasks.We validate our method through experiments in OpenAI Gym environments.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>40. <b>标题：Universality of parametric Coupling Flows over parametric  diffeomorphisms</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[201]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02906</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Junlong Lyu,  Zhitang Chen,  Chang Feng,  Wenjing Cun,  Shengyu Zhu,  Yanhui Geng,  Zhijie Xu,  Yongwei Chen</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：22 pages, 6 figures</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：proposed parametric coupling flows named para, invertible neural networks based, invertible linear transforms achieves, contextual bayesian optimization tasks, coupling flows cflows</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Invertible neural networks based on Coupling Flows CFlows) have variousapplications such as image synthesis and data compression.

Recent years have therefore witnessed great effort in developingcausal learning algorithms aiming to help AI achieve human-level intelligence.Due to the lack-of ground-truth data, one of the biggest challenges in currentcausal learning research is algorithm evaluations. This largely impedes thecross-pollination of AI and causal inference, and hinders the two fields tobenefit from the advances of the other. To bridge from conventional causalinference (i.e., based on statistical methods) to causal learning with big data(i.e., the intersection of causal inference and machine learning), in thissurvey, we review commonly-used datasets, evaluation methods, and measures forcausal learning using an evaluation pipeline similar to conventional machinelearning. We focus on the two fundamental causal-inference tasks andcausality-aware machine learning tasks. Limitations of current evaluationprocedures are also discussed. We then examine popular causal inferencetools/packages and conclude with primary challenges and opportunities forbenchmarking causal learning algorithms in the era of big data. The surveyseeks to bring to the forefront the urgency of developing publicly availablebenchmarks and consensus-building standards for causal learning evaluation withobservational data. In doing so, we hope to broaden the discussions andfacilitate collaboration to advance the innovation and application of causallearning.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>43. <b>标题：Causal Inference Using Tractable Circuits</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[211]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02891</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Adnan Darwiche</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Appeared in Why-21 workshop of NeurIPS 2021 (Causal Inference & Machine Learning: Why now?)</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：exploit causal mechanisms computationally, may potentially contribute, based supervised learning, causal graph parametrized, versatile causal inference</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The aim of this paper is to discuss a recent result which shows thatprobabilistic inference in the presence of (unknown) causal mechanisms can betractable for models that have traditionally been viewed as intractable. Thisresult was reported recently to facilitate model-based supervised learning butit can be interpreted in a causality context as follows. One can compile anon-parametric causal graph into an arithmetic circuit that supports inferencein time linear in the circuit size. The circuit is also non-parametric so itcan be used to estimate parameters from data and to further reason (in lineartime) about the causal graph parametrized by these estimates. Moreover, thecircuit size can sometimes be bounded even when the treewidth of the causalgraph is not, leading to tractable inference on models that have been deemedintractable previously. This has been enabled by a new technique that canexploit causal mechanisms computationally but without needing to know theiridentities (the classical setup in causal inference). Our goal is to provide acausality-oriented exposure to these new results and to speculate on how theymay potentially contribute to more scalable and versatile causal inference.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>44. <b>标题：Leveraging Approximate Symbolic Models for Reinforcement Learning via  Skill Diversity</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[213]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02886</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Lin Guan,  Sarath Sreedharan,  Subbarao Kambhampati</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：three different benchmark domains, model guided reinforcement learning, using symbolic models along, incomplete symbolic model information, incorporating symbolic task knowledge</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Creating reinforcement learning (RL) agents that are capable of accepting andleveraging task-specific knowledge from humans has been long identified as apossible strategy for developing scalable approaches for solving long-horizonproblems. While previous works have looked at the possibility of using symbolicmodels along with RL approaches, they tend to assume that the high-level actionmodels are executable at low level and the fluents can exclusively characterizeall desirable MDP states. This need not be true and this assumption overlooksone of the central technical challenges of incorporating symbolic taskknowledge, namely, that these symbolic models are going to be an incompleterepresentation of the underlying task. To this end, we introduce Symbolic-ModelGuided Reinforcement Learning, wherein we will formalize the relationshipbetween the symbolic model and the underlying MDP that will allow us to capturethe incompleteness of the symbolic model.

Unsatisfactory issues regarding interaction with existingroad users, performance in mixed-traffic areas and lack of interpretablebehavior remain key obstacles. To address these, we present a physics-basedneural network, based on a hybrid approach combining a social force modelextended by group force (SFMG) with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predictpedestrian trajectories considering its interaction with static obstacles,other pedestrians and pedestrian groups. We quantitatively and qualitativelyevaluate the model with respect to realistic prediction, prediction performanceand prediction "interpretability".

We show that an agent, after being trainedexclusively on the SE, is able to solve the corresponding real environment.While an SE acts as a full proxy to a real environment by learning about itsstate dynamics and rewards, an RN is a partial proxy that learns to augment orreplace rewards. We use bi-level optimization to evolve SEs and RNs: the innerloop trains the RL agent, and the outer loop trains the parameters of the SE /RN via an evolution strategy. We evaluate our proposed new concept on a broadrange of RL algorithms and classic control environments. In a one-to-onecomparison, learning an SE proxy requires more interactions with the realenvironment than training agents only on the real environment. However, oncesuch an SE has been learned, we do not need any interactions with the realenvironment to train new agents. Moreover, the learned SE proxies allow us totrain agents with fewer interactions while maintaining the original taskperformance. Our empirical results suggest that SEs achieve this result bylearning informed representations that bias the agents towards relevant states.Moreover, we find that these proxies are robust against hyperparametervariation and can also transfer to unseen agents.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>53. <b>标题：Human rights, democracy, and the rule of law assurance framework for AI  systems: A proposal</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[256]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02776</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：David Leslie,  Christopher Burr,  Mhairi Aitken,  Michael Katell,  Morgan Briggs,  Cami Rincon</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：341 pages</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：based human rights due diligence, human right due diligence, alan turing institute undertook, trustworthy ai innovation practices, trustworthy ai innovation practices</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Following on from the publication of its Feasibility Study in December 2020,the Council of Europe's Ad Hoc Committee on Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI) andits subgroups initiated efforts to formulate and draft its Possible Elements ofa Legal Framework on Artificial Intelligence, based on the Council of Europe'sstandards on human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. This document wasultimately adopted by the CAHAI plenary in December 2021. To support thiseffort, The Alan Turing Institute undertook a programme of research thatexplored the governance processes and practical tools needed to operationalisethe integration of human right due diligence with the assurance of trustworthyAI innovation practices.The resulting framework was completed and submitted to the Council of Europein September 2021.

Takentogether, these interlocking processes constitute a Human Rights, Democracy andthe Rule of Law Assurance Framework (HUDERAF). The HUDERAF combines theprocedural requirements for principles-based human rights due diligence withthe governance mechanisms needed to set up technical and socio-technicalguardrails for responsible and trustworthy AI innovation practices. Its purposeis to provide an accessible and user-friendly set of mechanisms forfacilitating compliance with a binding legal framework on artificialintelligence, based on the Council of Europe's standards on human rights,democracy, and the rule of law, and to ensure that AI innovation projects arecarried out with appropriate levels of public accountability, transparency, anddemocratic governance.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>54. <b>标题：Pipe Overflow: Smashing Voice Authentication for Fun and Profit</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[263]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02751</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Shimaa Ahmed,  Yash Wani,  Ali Shahin Shamsabadi,  Mohammad Yaghini,  Ilia Shumailov,  Nicolas Papernot,  Kassem Fawaz</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：producing analog adversarial examples directly, enabled personal devices powered, tasks like speaker identification, targeted adversarial examples, modern systems protect</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Recent years have seen a surge of popularity of acoustics-enabled personaldevices powered by machine learning. Yet, machine learning has proven to bevulnerable to adversarial examples. Large number of modern systems protectthemselves against such attacks by targeting the artificiality, i.e., theydeploy mechanisms to detect the lack of human involvement in generating theadversarial examples. However, these defenses implicitly assume that humans areincapable of producing meaningful and targeted adversarial examples. In thispaper, we show that this base assumption is wrong. In particular, wedemonstrate that for tasks like speaker identification, a human is capable ofproducing analog adversarial examples directly with little cost andsupervision: by simply speaking through a tube, an adversary reliablyimpersonates other speakers in eyes of ML models for speaker identification.Our findings extend to a range of other acoustic-biometric tasks such asliveness, bringing into question their use in security-critical settings inreal life, such as phone banking.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>55. <b>标题：The Self-Driving Car: Crossroads at the Bleeding Edge of Artificial  Intelligence and Law</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[267]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02734</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Scott McLachlan,  Evangelia Kyrimi,  Kudakwashe Dube,  Norman Fenton,  Burkhard Schafer</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：areas truly requiring ongoing legislative attention, effort expended towards understanding, still mostly speculative, help us understand, comprehensive literature review</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) features are increasingly being embedded in carsand are central to the operation of self-driving cars (SDC).

As the proliferation of context-awareservices, the diversified personal preferences causes disagreeing conditionaldistributions among user data, which leads to poor inference performance. Inthis sense, clustered federated learning is proposed to group user devices withsimilar preference and provide each cluster with a personalized model. Thiscalls for innovative design in edge association that involves user clusteringand also resource management optimization. We formulate an accuracy-costtrade-off optimization problem by jointly considering model accuracy,communication resource allocation and energy consumption. To comply withparameter encryption techniques in FL, we propose an iterative solutionprocedure which employs deep reinforcement learning based approach at cloudserver for edge association. The reward function consists of minimized energyconsumption at each base station and the averaged model accuracy of all users.Under our proposed solution, multiple edge base station are fully exploited torealize cost efficient personalized federated learning without any priorknowledge on model parameters. Simulation results show that our proposedstrategy outperforms existing strategies in achieving accurate learning at lowenergy cost.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>57. <b>标题：Triangle Graph Interest Network for Click-through Rate Prediction</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[280]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02698</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Wensen Jiang,  Yizhu Jiao,  Qingqin Wang,  Chuanming Liang,  Lijie Guo,  Yao Zhang,  Zhijun Sun,  Yun Xiong,  Yangyong Zhu</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：This paper is accepted by WSDM 2022.

However, it is difficult to handlesparse user behaviors or broaden interest exploration. Recently, someresearchers incorporate the item-item co-occurrence graph as an auxiliary. Dueto the elusiveness of user interests, those works still fail to determine thereal motivation of user click behaviors. Besides, those works are more biasedtowards popular or similar commodities. They lack an effective mechanism tobreak the diversity restrictions. In this paper, we point out two specialproperties of triangles in the item-item graphs for recommendation systems:Intra-triangle homophily and Inter-triangle heterophiy. Based on this, wepropose a novel and effective framework named Triangle Graph Interest Network(TGIN). For each clicked item in user behavior sequences, we introduce thetriangles in its neighborhood of the item-item graphs as a supplement. TGINregards these triangles as the basic units of user interests, which provide theclues to capture the real motivation for a user clicking an item. Wecharacterize every click behavior by aggregating the information of severalinterest units to alleviate the elusive motivation problem. The attentionmechanism determines users' preference for different interest units. Byselecting diverse and relative triangles, TGIN brings in novel andserendipitous items to expand exploration opportunities of user interests.Then, we aggregate the multi-level interests of historical behavior sequencesto improve CTR prediction. Extensive experiments on both public and industrialdatasets clearly verify the effectiveness of our framework.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>58. <b>标题：Exploration with Multi-Sample Target Values for Distributional  Reinforcement Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[282]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02693</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Michael Teng,  Michiel van de Panne,  Frank Wood</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Submitted to ICML 2022</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：sample target value estimation, sample target values, often modeled via, method via visualization, improved distributional estimates</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Distributional reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a value-network thatpredicts the full distribution of the returns for a given state, often modeledvia a quantile-based critic.

However,such datasets are often small, making the training of deep neural networkarchitectures ineffective. For time-series, the suite of data augmentationtricks we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need tomaintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a GenerativeAdversarial Network (GAN) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool.RNN-based GANs suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model longsequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle theseproblems, we introduce TTS-GAN, a transformer-based GAN which can successfullygenerate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length,similar to the real ones. Both the generator and discriminator networks of theGAN model are built using a pure transformer encoder architecture. We usevisualizations and dimensionality reduction techniques to demonstrate thesimilarity of real and generated time-series data.

Thispaper presents a mechanism to harness the narrative output of large languagemodels and produce diagrams or "maps" of the relationships that are latent inthe weights of such models as the GPT-3.

In this paper, we focus on sparse training and highlight aperhaps counter-intuitive finding, that random pruning at initialization can bequite powerful for the sparse training of modern neural networks. Without anydelicate pruning criteria or carefully pursued sparsity structures, weempirically demonstrate that sparsely training a randomly pruned network fromscratch can match the performance of its dense equivalent. There are two keyfactors that contribute to this revival: (i) the network sizes matter: as theoriginal dense networks grow wider and deeper, the performance of training arandomly pruned sparse network will quickly grow to matching that of its denseequivalent, even at high sparsity ratios; (ii) appropriate layer-wise sparsityratios can be pre-chosen for sparse training, which shows to be anotherimportant performance booster. Simple as it looks, a randomly pruned subnetworkof Wide ResNet-50 can be sparsely trained to outperforming a dense WideResNet-50, on ImageNet. We also observed such randomly pruned networksoutperform dense counterparts in other favorable aspects, such asout-of-distribution detection, uncertainty estimation, and adversarialrobustness. Overall, our results strongly suggest there is larger-than-expectedroom for sparse training at scale, and the benefits of sparsity might be moreuniversal beyond carefully designed pruning.

In this paper, a communication efficientalgorithm, called ordering-based alternating direction method of multipliers(OADMM) is devised in a general fully decentralized network setting where aworker can only exchange messages with neighbors. Compared to the classicalADMM, a key feature of OADMM is that transmissions are ordered among workers ateach iteration such that a worker with the most informative data broadcasts itslocal variable to neighbors first, and neighbors who have not transmitted yetcan update their local variables based on that received transmission. In OADMM,we prohibit workers from transmitting if their current local variables are notsufficiently different from their previously transmitted value. A variant ofOADMM, called SOADMM, is proposed where transmissions are ordered buttransmissions are never stopped for each node at each iteration. Numericalresults demonstrate that given a targeted accuracy, OADMM can significantlyreduce the number of communications compared to existing algorithms includingADMM. We also show numerically that SOADMM can accelerate convergence,resulting in communication savings compared to the classical ADMM.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>68. <b>标题：Symmetric Volume Maps</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[339]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02568</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：S.

Ourformulation minimizes a distortion energy designed to extract mapssymmetrically, i.e., without dependence on the ordering of the source andtarget domains. We accompany our method with theoretical discussion describingthe consequences of this symmetry assumption, leading us to select asymmetrized ARAP energy that favors isometric correspondences. Our finalformulation optimizes for near-isometry while matching the boundary. Wedemonstrate our method on a diverse geometric dataset, producing low-distortionmatchings that align to the boundary.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>69. <b>标题：Unsupervised Learning on 3D Point Clouds by Clustering and Contrasting</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[349]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02543</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Guofeng Mei,  Litao Yu,  Qiang Wu,  Jian Zhang</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：extract features without human intervention, extract discriminating local features based, alleviate human labeling remains, criterion extends standard cross, like soft clustering algorithm</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Learning from unlabeled or partially labeled data to alleviate human labelingremains a challenging research topic in 3D modeling. Along this line,unsupervised representation learning is a promising direction to auto-extractfeatures without human intervention. This paper proposes a general unsupervisedapproach, named \textbf{ConClu}, to perform the learning of point-wise andglobal features by jointly leveraging point-level clustering and instance-levelcontrasting. Specifically, for one thing, we design an Expectation-Maximization(EM) like soft clustering algorithm that provides local supervision to extractdiscriminating local features based on optimal transport. We show that thiscriterion extends standard cross-entropy minimization to an optimal transportproblem, which we solve efficiently using a fast variant of the Sinkhorn-Knoppalgorithm. For another, we provide an instance-level contrasting method tolearn the global geometry, which is formulated by maximizing the similaritybetween two augmentations of one point cloud. Experimental evaluations ondownstream applications such as 3D object classification and semanticsegmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and show that itcan outperform state-of-the-art techniques.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>70. <b>标题：TorchMD-NET: Equivariant Transformers for Neural Network based Molecular  Potentials</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[350]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02541</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Philipp Thölke,  Gianni De Fabritiis</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：previously shown great success, extensive attention weight analysis, conformers versus conformations sampled, reaching increasingly better accuracy, maintaining computational efficiency comparable</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>The prediction of quantum mechanical properties is historically plagued by atrade-off between accuracy and speed.

In this work, we reveal the vulnerability ofGNN to the imbalance of node labels. Traditional solutions for imbalancedclassification (e.g. resampling) are ineffective in node classification withoutconsidering the graph structure.

In this paper, wedevise a Gradient Descent method with Sparsification and Error Correction(GD-SEC) to improve the communications efficiency in a general worker-serverarchitecture. Motivated by a variety of wireless communications learningscenarios, GD-SEC reduces the number of bits per communication from worker toserver with no degradation in the order of the convergence rate. This enableslarger-scale model learning without sacrificing convergence or accuracy. Ateach iteration of GD-SEC, instead of directly transmitting the entire gradientvector, each worker computes the difference between its current gradient and alinear combination of its previously transmitted gradients, and then transmitsthe sparsified gradient difference to the server. A key feature of GD-SEC isthat any given component of the gradient difference vector will not betransmitted if its magnitude is not sufficiently large. An error correctiontechnique is used at each worker to compensate for the error resulting fromsparsification. We prove that GD-SEC is guaranteed to converge for stronglyconvex, convex, and nonconvex optimization problems with the same order ofconvergence rate as GD. Furthermore, if the objective function is stronglyconvex, GD-SEC has a fast linear convergence rate. Numerical results not onlyvalidate the convergence rate of GD-SEC but also explore the communication bitsavings it provides. Given a target accuracy, GD-SEC can significantly reducethe communications load compared to the best existing algorithms withoutslowing down the optimization process.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>78. <b>标题：MarkovGNN: Graph Neural Networks on Markov Diffusion</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[383]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02470</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Md.

Nonetheless, current endeavors mostlyfocus on Euclidean data, and its formulation for graph-structured data is notclear and remains under-explored, given the two-fold fundamental challenges: 1)the inter-connection among nodes in one graph, which induces non-IID generationof data points even under the same environment, and 2) the structuralinformation in the input graph, which is also informative for prediction. Inthis paper, we formulate the OOD problem for node-level prediction on graphsand develop a new domain-invariant learning approach, namedExplore-to-Extrapolate Risk Minimization, that facilitates GNNs to leverageinvariant graph features for prediction. The key difference to existinginvariant models is that we design multiple context explorers (specified asgraph editers in our case) that are adversarially trained to maximize thevariance of risks from multiple virtual environments. Such a design enables themodel to extrapolate from a single observed environment which is the commoncase for node-level prediction.

The main idea behind currentapproaches to solving letter-string analogies is to design heuristic rules forextracting analogy structures and constructing analogy mappings. However, onekey problem is that it is difficult to build a comprehensive and exhaustive setof analogy structures which can fully describe the subtlety of analogies. Thisproblem makes current approaches unable to handle complicated letter-stringanalogy problems. In this paper, we propose Neural logic analogy learning(Noan), which is a dynamic neural architecture driven by differentiable logicreasoning to solve analogy problems. Each analogy problem is converted intological expressions consisting of logical variables and basic logicaloperations (AND, OR, and NOT). More specifically, Noan learns the logicalvariables as vector embeddings and learns each logical operation as a neuralmodule. In this way, the model builds computational graph integrating neuralnetwork with logical reasoning to capture the internal logical structure of theinput letter strings. The analogy learning problem then becomes a True/Falseevaluation problem of the logical expressions. Experiments show that ourmachine learning-based Noan approach outperforms state-of-the-art approaches onstandard letter-string analogy benchmark datasets.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>85. <b>标题：SMODICE: Versatile Offline Imitation Learning via State Occupancy  Matching</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[405]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02433</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yecheng Jason Ma,  Andrew Shen,  Dinesh Jayaraman,  Osbert Bastani</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：Project website: this https URL</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：propose state matching offline distribution correction estimation, significantly outperforms prior state, three offline il settings, dimensional offline benchmarks, three problem settings</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>We propose State Matching Offline DIstribution Correction Estimation(SMODICE), a novel and versatile algorithm for offline imitation learning (IL)via state-occupancy matching.

However, the control policies trained for an RLagent crucially depend on user-defined, state-based reward functions. Poorlydesigned rewards can lead to policies that do get maximal rewards but fail tosatisfy desired task objectives or are unsafe. There are several examples ofthe use of formal languages such as temporal logics and automata to specifyhigh-level task specifications for robots (in lieu of Markovian rewards).Recent efforts have focused on inferring state-based rewards from formalspecifications; here, the goal is to provide (probabilistic) guarantees thatthe policy learned using RL (with the inferred rewards) satisfies thehigh-level formal specification. A key drawback of several of these techniquesis that the rewards that they infer are sparse: the agent receives positiverewards only upon completion of the task and no rewards otherwise. Thisnaturally leads to poor convergence properties and high variance during RL. Inthis work, we propose using formal specifications in the form of symbolicautomata: these serve as a generalization of both bounded-time temporallogic-based specifications as well as automata. Furthermore, our use ofsymbolic automata allows us to define non-sparse potential-based rewards whichempirically shape the reward surface, leading to better convergence during RL.We also show that our potential-based rewarding strategy still allows us toobtain the policy that maximizes the satisfaction of the given specification.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>90. <b>标题：Self-Adaptive Forecasting for Improved Deep Learning on Non-Stationary  Time-Series</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[420]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02403</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Sercan O.

SAFintegrates a self-adaptation stage prior to forecasting based on `backcasting',i.e. predicting masked inputs backward in time. This is a form of test-timetraining that creates a self-supervised learning problem on test samples beforeperforming the prediction task. In this way, our method enables efficientadaptation of encoded representations to evolving distributions, leading tosuperior generalization. SAF can be integrated with any canonicalencoder-decoder based time-series architecture such as recurrent neuralnetworks or attention-based architectures.

In this paper, we propose a new approach of reconstructing thepolicy gradient from the start state without requiring a particular samplingstrategy.

However, different featureimportance methods are likely to compute different feature importance rankseven for the same dataset and classifier. Hence such interchangeable use offeature importance methods can lead to conclusion instabilities unless there isa strong agreement among different methods. Therefore, in this paper, weevaluate the agreement between the feature importance ranks associated with thestudied classifiers through a case study of 18 software projects and sixcommonly used classifiers. We find that: 1) The computed feature importanceranks by CA and CS methods do not always strongly agree with each other. 2) Thecomputed feature importance ranks by the studied CA methods exhibit a strongagreement including the features reported at top-1 and top-3 ranks for a givendataset and classifier, while even the commonly used CS methods yield vastlydifferent feature importance ranks. Such findings raise concerns about thestability of conclusions across replicated studies. We further observe that thecommonly used defect datasets are rife with feature interactions and thesefeature interactions impact the computed feature importance ranks of the CSmethods (not the CA methods). We demonstrate that removing these featureinteractions, even with simple methods like CFS improves agreement between thecomputed feature importance ranks of CA and CS methods. In light of ourfindings, we provide guidelines for stakeholders and practitioners whenperforming model interpretation and directions for future research, e.g.,future research is needed to investigate the impact of advanced featureinteraction removal methods on computed feature importance ranks of differentCS methods.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>95. <b>标题：Automatic Identification of Self-Admitted Technical Debt from Different  Sources</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[430]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02387</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Yikun Li,  Mohamed Soliman,  Paris Avgeriou</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：e ., source code comments, g ., code comments, issue tracking systems ),, source code comments, g ., maintainability</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Technical debt is a metaphor describing the situation that long-term benefits(e.g., maintainability and evolvability of software) are traded for short-termgoals.

Selecting a reviewer who lacksexpertise and understanding can slow development or result in more defects. Todate, most reviewer recommendation systems rely primarily on historical filechange and review information; those who changed or reviewed a file in the pastare the best positioned to review in the future. We posit that while theseapproaches are able to identify and suggest qualified reviewers, they may beblind to reviewers who have the needed expertise and have simply neverinteracted with the changed files before. To address this, we present CORAL, anovel approach to reviewer recommendation that leverages a socio-technicalgraph built from the rich set of entities (developers, repositories, files,pull requests, work-items, etc.) and their relationships in modern source codemanagement systems. We employ a graph convolutional neural network on thisgraph and train it on two and a half years of history on 332 repositories. Weshow that CORAL is able to model the manual history of reviewer selectionremarkably well. Further, based on an extensive user study, we demonstrate thatthis approach identifies relevant and qualified reviewers who traditionalreviewer recommenders miss, and that these developers desire to be included inthe review process. Finally, we find that "classical" reviewer recommendationsystems perform better on smaller (in terms of developers) software projectswhile CORAL excels on larger projects, suggesting that there is "no one modelto rule them all."</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>97. <b>标题：A Discourse on MetODS: Meta-Optimized Dynamical Synapses for  Meta-Reinforcement Learning</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[434]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02363</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Mathieu Chalvidal,  Thomas Serre,  Rufin VanRullen</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：computational mechanisms support flexible behavioral adaptation, robust reinforcement learning programs emerge spontaneously, leverages fast synaptic dynamics influenced, parameters governing metods synaptic processes, model learning powerful control rules</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>Recent meta-reinforcement learning work has emphasized the importance ofmnemonic control for agents to quickly assimilate relevant experience in newcontexts and suitably adapt their policy.

Here, we establish an intercomparisonof some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity inexplaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raiseawareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight intothe relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. Theconsidered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark,where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to helpobjectively assess their performance.

However, more complexanalysis for classification and discovery of feature genes or sampleobservations requires sophisticated computational approaches. In this review,we compile various statistical and computational tools used in analysis ofexpression microarray data. Even though, the methods are discussed in thecontext of expression microarray data, they can also be applied for theanalysis of RNA sequencing or quantitative proteomics datasets. We specificallydiscuss methods for missing value (gene expression) imputation, feature genescaling, selection and extraction of features for dimensionality reduction, andlearning and analysis of expression data. We discuss the types of missingvalues and the methods and approaches usually employed in their imputation. Wealso discuss methods of data transformation and feature scaling viz.normalization and standardization. Various approaches used in feature selectionand extraction are also reviewed.

The proposed method first pre-processes the received signal byusing a zero-forcing (ZF) detector and then uses a neural network consisting ofa convolutional neural network (CNN) followed by a fully-connected neuralnetwork (FCNN). The FCNN part uses only two fully-connected layers, which canbe adapted to yield a trade-off between complexity and bit error rate (BER)performance. This two-stage approach prevents the getting stuck of neuralnetwork in a saddle point and enables IM blocks processing independently. Ithas been demonstrated that the proposed deep convolutional neural network-baseddetection and demodulation scheme provides better BER performance compared toZF detector with a reasonable complexity increase. We conclude thatnon-orthogonal waveforms combined with IM schemes with the help of deeplearning is a promising physical layer (PHY) scheme for future wirelessnetworks</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>105. <b>标题：Deep Learning-Aided Spatial Multiplexing with Index Modulation</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[494]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02856</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Merve Turhan,  Ersin Ozturk,  Hakan Ali Cirpan</p>  <p><b>备注</b>：</p>  <p><b>关键词</b>：zf detector without increasing computational complexity, significant error performance gains compared, dl )- aided data detection, eventually reveals reduced complexity, using subblockbased detection provided</p>  <details>    <summary><b>点击查看摘要</b></summary>    <p>In this paper, deep learning (DL)-aided data detection of spatialmultiplexing (SMX) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission withindex modulation (IM) (Deep-SMX-IM) has been proposed. Deep-SMX-IM has beenconstructed by combining a zero-forcing (ZF) detector and DL technique. Theproposed method uses the significant advantages of DL techniques to learntransmission characteristics of the frequency and spatial domains. Furthermore,thanks to using subblockbased detection provided by IM, Deep-SMX-IM is astraightforward method, which eventually reveals reduced complexity. It hasbeen shown that Deep-SMX-IM has significant error performance gains compared toZF detector without increasing computational complexity for different systemconfigurations.</p>  </details></details><details>  <summary>106. <b>标题：OMLT: Optimization & Machine Learning Toolkit</b></summary>  <p><b>编号</b>：[533]</p>  <p><b>链接</b>：https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02414</p>  <p><b>作者</b>：Francesco Ceccon,  Jordan Jalving,  Joshua Haddad,  Alexander Thebelt,  Calvin Tsay,  Carl D.

 另外，本文在句级表征获取方面进行了设计。用BERT类模型获取句级表征一般是通过特殊token<code>[CLS]</code>获取，也有部分方法通过对各输入token对应的编码特征进行池化操作得到句级表征，如均值池化、最大值池化、LSTM池化等。初赛阶段方案采用<code>[CLS]</code>对应编码输出作为句级表征，但后续实验发现<strong>为每个标签设置单独的表征</strong>能极大提升分类的性能，两者方案对比如下：</p><blockquote><p><strong>反直觉</strong>：微调过程中尝试多种方法建模标签间依赖都失效，如Self-Attention、GCN等，而将两个任务分开训练能得到更好的实验结果，也就是说区域预测与类型预测间没有较大的关联性，更有部分选手采用小型深度模型(如RNN)对各个标签单独建模。</p></blockquote><p><img

Recognition)是NLP中一项非常基础的任务，是信息提取、问答系统、句法分析、机器翻译等众多NLP任务的重要基础工具，具体的任务是<strong>从文本中挑选出实体类型</strong>。</p><p>深度学习网络的一般结构是“主体编码模型-解码器”的组合。在自然语言处理领域，主体编码模型选择很多，如卷积神经网络、循环神经网络、Bert等。在命名实体识别任务中使用条件随机场(Conditional Random Filed, CRF)作为解码器，是将命名实体识别任务转换为序列标注问题。</p><p>常用的序列标注主要有<code>BIO</code>和<code>BIOES</code>标注两种：1) <code>BIO</code>将数据标注为<code>B-X, I-X, O</code>格式，其中<code>B</code>表示实体起始位置(Begin)，<code>I</code>表示实体中间(Intermediate)，<code>O</code>表示其他(Other)无关字符；2) <code>BIOES</code>在<code>BIO</code>基础上添加了<code>E</code>表示实体结尾(End)和<code>S</code>表示单个字符(Single)。<a href="https://www.clips.uantwerpen.be/conll2003/">CoNLL2003</a>是常用的NER数据集。</p><figure

词嵌入(embedding)层；2) 双向LSTM特征提取层，以及之后的线性分类曾；3) 捕获标签间关系的条件随机场层。下面讲解说明各层的作用及计算方法。当然还有一些细节性的问题，如dropout的设置等，这里不过多展开。</p><p><img
